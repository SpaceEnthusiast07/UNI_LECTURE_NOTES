[Coursework Specification](https://ele.exeter.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/5547597/mod_resource/content/2/Coursework%20Description%20Final.pdf)

For each numbered section in the specification, I will write some notes/thoughts on each.


#### 1. Introduction
 - Apply fundamental concepts of algorithms and data structures.
 - Emphasises correctness and algorithmic efficiency.
 - Compare brute force approach with a more sophisticated approach.


#### 3. Scenario Description
 - I am part of a student society committee.
 - We need to plan a special event weekend.
 - We have received funding and have a certain amount of time.
 - We cannot do everything we would like.
 - We have a list of activities.
 - Each activity has a time requirement, cost and estimated enjoyment value.
 - We need to implement an *Event Planner* that helps the committee decide which activities to include.
 - The goal is to maximise the enjoyment value while staying in the *constraints of time and cost*.
 - You cannot partially do an activity nor repeat the same activity.
 - *The challenge* is to find which *best combination of activities* fits within the time and/or cost *constraints*.
