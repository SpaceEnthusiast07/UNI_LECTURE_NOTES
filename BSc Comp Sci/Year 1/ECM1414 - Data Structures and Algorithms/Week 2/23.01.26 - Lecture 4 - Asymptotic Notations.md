##### What is Asymptotic Notation?
 - ***Asymptotic notation*** boils down to a way to measure an algorithm's "efficiency" as its workload grows.


##### Counting Steps: Finding $T(n)$
 - Before using notations like "Big O", we first need to understand how much work a piece of code actually does.
 - ***The Goal***: We want to find a mathematical function, $T(n)$, that represents the total number of operations (steps) the computer performs for an input size $n$.
 - ***The Process***: You look at every line of code and count how many times it runs.
 - Example algorithm:![[Pasted image 20260123145741.png]]
	 - A simple assignment like `int partialSum = 0;` happens *1 time* regardless of the input size $n$.
	 - Therefore `int n`, `int i = 0;`, and `return partialSum` all happen *1 time*.
	 - A loop like `for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {}` runs its comparison ($i \leq n$) and increment ($i++$) roughly $n+1$ times.
		 - If the comparison was $i<n$, since $i$ starts at 0 and goes to $n-1$, it happens a total of $n+1$ times.
		 - However, since it is an equal ($i\leq n$), there is one more comparison and incrementation, hence they occur $n+1$ times.
	 - Operations inside the loop, like `partialSum += i*i*i;`, also run $n+1$ times.
		 - You have 2 multiplications, one addition and one assignment that all happen *$n+1$ times*
 - ***The Result***: By adding these all up, you get a total of $T(n) = 8n + 11$. This tells us that as the input size increases, the time taken grows linearly.


##### Asymptotic Analysis
 - This analysis says that when $n$ grows very large, e.g. 1 billion, the small constants (like $8$) and the small additions (like $11$) become irrelevant.
 - I.e. the constants and coefficients don't change the number of operations by much when $n$ is very large.
 - Therefore, we can ignore them and the function simply becomes $T(n) = n$.
 - ***The Big Fish Rule***: In a function such as $10n^3 + 24n^2 + 3n\log n + 144$, the $n^3$ term is the "big fish". As $n$ grows, $n^3$ becomes so much larger than $n^2$ or 144 that it effectively dictates the performance. I.e. it is the dominant term.
