##### Algorithm History
 - The name 'algorithm' comes from a Persian mathematician called Al-Khwarizmi.
 - He wrote a book called "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing".
 - His name was written as "Algorithmi" when the book was translated to Latin.
 - Today, we define the work Algorithm as a "computation method".


##### Possible Definitions
 - No one has a universally agreed upon definition for what an algorithm is.
 - A couple of examples include:
	 - The term algorithm is used in computer science to describe methods for solving problems that are suited for computer implementation. [Sedgewick 2011]
	 - An algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions, each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time. [Aho, Hopcroft & Ulman 1975]

>[!tip] Rolando says his favourite definition is: "An algorithm is a finite sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem, i.e. for obtaining the required output for any legitimate input in a finite amount of time." [Levitin 2003]
