##### Hackers
 - A ***hacker*** is a person who *enjoys exploring* the details of a *programmable systems* and how to *stretch* their capabilities.
 - Over time their has been various eras of hacking:
	 - Era 1: The *joy* of programming
	 - Era 2: The rise of hacking's *dark side*
	 - Era 3: Hacking as a destructive and *criminal* tool
 - Hacker skill levels
	 - *Apprentice* (Low-level): Use ready-made tools, responsible for the majority of attacks and are the easiest to defend against.
	 - *Journeyman* (Intermediate): They use modified tools, more targeted and harder to stop.
	 - *Master* (Advanced): Create new tools and exploit zero-day (security flaw in software unknown to vendor) vulnerabilities.
 - Types of hackers
	 - *Black-hat*: *Malicious* intent, steal or destroy data
	 - *White-hat*: *Ethical* hackers testing systems for weaknesses
	 - *Grey-hat*: The middle ground - explore systems without permission but *without harmful intent*


##### Hacking Tools and Techniques
 - Malware Types
	 - *Virus*: Attaches to legitimate files, spreads and damages other files
	 - *Worm*: Self-replicating malware, spreads without host files
	 - *Trojan Horse*: Appears harmless but installs malicious software, can create backdoor
	 - *Backdoor*: Hidden access to bypass security
	 - *Ransomware*: Encrypts data and demands payment
 - Other Approaches
	 - *Social Engineering*: Manipulating people to reveal their secrets, e.g. passwords or bank details
	 - *Phishing*: Fake emails or websites that trick users into providing their confidential details
	 - *Hacktivism*: Politically or socially motivated hacking


##### Cybercrime and Legal Response
 - *Cyberwarfare*
	 - A state or organisation hacking another for espionage, sabotage, propaganda or military gain
 - ***Computer Misuse Act 1990***
	 - Covers three key offences:
		 - *Unauthorised access* - up to one year in prison
		 - *Unauthorised access with intent to commit further crime* - up to 5 years
		 - *Unauthorised modification of data* - up to 10 years
 - ***Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA 2000)*** - UK law that regulates the use of *surveillance* and *investigatory powers* by *public authorities* to ensure *human rights* are respected.


##### Security Measures
 - ***Authentication***
	 - Verify identify using a password, 2FA, security questions, tokens or a smart card
 - ***Authorisation and Validation***
	 - Controlling who can access what
	 - Software from unverified sources can undermine security
 - ***Network Security***
	 - Protecting data in transit (important for online banking and e-commerce)
	 - Security must be consistent, end-to-end encryption


##### Authentication in Distributed Systems
 - When multiple organisations or services work together, they each have their own security system (logins, firewalls and trust rules)
 - This creates problems including how one organisation can verify another's identity safely?
 - Key Terms
	 - ***Security Realm***: A group of users/systems managed under a single authority, e.g. a uni network or company domain
	 - ***Heterogeneous Cross-Realm Authentication (HCRA)***: A process that allows secure communication *between* two different *security realms* that don't directly trust each other


##### Business Sessions for Service Interactions
 - A ***business session*** is a *secure* digital meeting between *multiple services* (e.g. consumer, producer and shipper) that *automatically interact* to complete a business transaction
 - Key Ideas
	 - *Business Flow*: The automated workflow, e.g. placing and order and having it shipped
	 - *Session Partners*: Each service involved in the business flow
	 - *Session Management*: Keeps track of who's part of the transaction and ensure only trusted services can communicate


##### Scenario
 - Why is HCRA needed?
	 - A *consumer* buys a product from a *producer* (trusted link created)
	 - The producer picks a *shipper* at runtime to deliver the product, but the consumer doesn't know the shipper
 - *Problem*: How can the consumer trust the shipper's messages if they haven't interacted before?
 - *Solution*: Use a central authority (***Session Authority***) to handle *authentication and key distribution* between all partners


##### Two- vs Multi-Party Authentication
 - ***Two Party Authentication***
	 - Works between two known parties, e.g. user $\leftrightarrow$ website
	 - They share a session key for secure communication
	 - Doesn't scale well when you have more than two parties involved dynamically
 - ***Multi Party Session Technique***
	 - Introduces a *Session Authority* that oversees all partners
	 - Each participant gets a *session key* distributed *securely* by this authority
	 - When a new partner joins, the *session authority* updates all others with the *new session details*
	 - Benefit: Each new partner doesn't need to establish trust with all other partners, just the *session authority*


##### Multi-Party Session Management
 - The new model simplifies authentication, instead of everyone trusting everyone $O(n^2)$, everyone only needs to trust the session authority $O(n)$
 - The new model handles:
	 - *Message Routing* - Ensuring messages reach the correct, verified session partner
	 - *Secret Key Distribution* - Provides each participant with secure keys to verify identity and encrypt communication


##### Key Distribution
 - ***Single Secret Key***
	 - All participants share one secret key
	 - Simple, but less secure (if one is compromised, all are)
 - ***Individual Secret Keys***
	 - Each pair of participants have their own key
	 - More secure but more complex to manage
 - The goal is to balance *security* and *scalability*


##### Scenario
 - A new session is started with a *Session ID*
 - The Session Authority (SA) manages:
	 - Registering new partners (consumer, producer, shipper)
	 - Introducing them to each other securely
	 - Distributing secret keys
 - Once registered, partners can send authenticated and encrypted messages


##### Multi-Party Authentication for Web Services
 - Each message sent between web services includes:
	 - A *Session ID*, *Origin*, *Destination* and *MAC* (Message Authentication Code)
 - Handlers (software companies) automatically add and verify this info to ensure:
	 - The message is from the legitimate partner
	 - It hasn't been tampered with in transit
 - If anything doesn't match, the message is rejected


##### Experimental System & Evaluation
 - Testing Goals
	 - Does it scale well, i.e. can it handle many services at once
	 - Works with other existing security protocols
 - Results
	 - The system was formally tested and experimentally tested
	 - It showed good performance, only adding a small delay
	 - Proved that this approach could build trust in large distributed systems, such as cloud platforms or service oriented architectures
