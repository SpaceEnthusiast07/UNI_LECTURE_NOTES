##### What is a Software Contract
 - A ***software contract*** is a *legal agreement* between a client and a software developer/company
 - It sets out:
	 - The *scope of work* (what's being built)
	 - Who does what (*responsibilities*)
	 - Who owns the software (*copyright*)
	 - What happens if things go wrong (liability, arbitration, termination)
	 - Post-delivery support (maintenance, warranty)
 - Summary: It ensures both sides understand their rights, duties and how disputes are handled


##### What makes a Contract Legal
 - A valid contract must include:
	 - Agreement - both parties consent
	 - Consideration - something of value is exchanged (e.g. money for software)
	 - Intent - both intend legal consequences
	 - Obligations & criteria - who must do what, and how disputes are solved


##### Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
 - ***SOA*** = building software as independent services that communicate via networks
 - Benefits:
	 - Loose coupling - services depend on each other minimally
	 - Reusability - existing services can be reused across projects
	 - Flexibility - easy to modify, scale and integrate


##### Scope of Work
 - Defines what the project includes and what is doesn't:
	 - *Product scope* - features and functions of the final software
	 - *Project scope* - the work needed to create it
 -
