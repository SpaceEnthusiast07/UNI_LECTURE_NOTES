##### What is Learning?
>[!info] "Learning denotes changes in a system that make it perform a task better next time." - Herbert Simon
 - In other words, a computer learns by adjusting itself based on experience (data) so that it can make better decisions in the future.


##### Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
 - ***Supervised Learning*** involves training a ML model on *labeled* data - data that comes with correct answers
	 - You train an algorithm using data with known answers (called ***ground truth***)
	 - Example: a model is trained using pictures of dogs and cats. Each picture has a label establishing the ground truth of that image.
	 - After training, the algorithm can predict new examples, such as unseen pictures of dogs or cats
 - ***Unsupervised Learning*** is about finding *hidden structure* or *patterns* in *unlabeled* data - data that doesn't come with answers
	 - The data has no labels
	 - The algorithm must find patterns or structure on its own
	 - Example: grouping similar customers or products together automatically


##### Where Unsupervised Learning is Used
 - *Customer Segmentation* - find groups such as "students", "parents", "party-goers", etc.
 - *Fraud Detection* - find unusual transactions or behaviours
 - *Discovering new species* - group animals based on shared traits
 - *Pre-processing for classification* - automatically form categories that supervised learning can later use
 - In all these cases, we don't know the categories beforehand - the algorithm discovers them


##### Methods used to find Patterns
 - These are three methods unsupervised learning models use to find hidden structure, patterns or relationships in data:
	 1. Clustering
	 2. Community Detection
	 3. Topic Modelling


##### Clustering
 - ***Clustering*** = grouping similar data points together
 - For example, in a scatter plot of data points:
	 - Points that are close to each other $\rightarrow$ likely part of the same cluster
	 - Points far apart $\rightarrow$ different clusters
 - General Steps:
	 1. Go through all the data points
	 2. Measure the distance or similarity between points
	 3. Form clusters of points that are close together
 - So, a cluster is a group of similar things


##### Community Detection
 - In networks (such as social media), ***community detection*** finds groups of *connects nodes*
 - Example: clusters of friends who interact more with each other than with others
 - Used in network science - a field that studies how things (people, computers, genes, etc.) connect and interact
 - Similar idea to clustering - but applied to *networks* or *graphs* instead of plain data points


##### Topic Modelling
 - ***Topic Modelling*** is used to automatically find *themes* or *subjects* in large sets of text documents
 - Example: 
	 - Customer Reviews
		 - "Good bread, good coffee"
		 - "Terrible coffee"
		 - "The bread is ok... cappuccino is the best"
	 - The algorithm find topics like:
		 1. Bread
		 2. Coffee
		 3. Store/building
 - No one tells it what the topics are - it learns from word patterns
 - This can also be used for languages, news articles, research papers, etc.


##### Historical Example: Cholera Outbreak
 - In the 1850s, Dr. john Snow mapped out cholera deaths in London.
 - He noticed clusters of deaths around a particular water pump (Broad Street)
 - His Method:
	 - Plot data (deaths)
	 - Find clusters of nearby points (areas with more deaths)
	 - Hypothesis: water pump caused the outbreak
	 - Authorities removed the pump handle and the outbreak stopped
 - This early form of *data-driven clustering* is considered one of the first examples of *data science*


##### Voronoi Tessellation
 - A ***Voronoi Tessellation*** divides a map into *regions* based on which "point" is nearest
 - Example: if hospitals are the "points" on a map, each house belongs to the region of its *closest hospital*
 - Used in geography, delivery zones and facility planning
 - John Snow's cholera map was a real world example of this concept


##### Examples of Clustering Algorithms
 1. ***K-Means***
	 - You input how many clusters $(K)$ to find
	 - It places "centres" (means) and groups points around the nearest one
	 - Simple, fast , but you must pick $K$
 2. ***DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)***
	 - Fins areas of high data density (many points close together)
	 - Doesn't require $K$
	 - Can handle *noise* (outliers)
 3. ***Hierarchical Clustering***
	 - Builds a tree-like hierarchy of clusters
	 - Can be:
		 - *Agglomerative*: start with each point alone and merge clusters
		 - *Divisive*: start with all points together and split into clusters


##### Types of Clustering

##### Important Factors in Clustering
 1. *What data is represented and how*
	 - How you describe your data matters
	 - Example: representing people by age and income vs. by hobbies leads to different clusters
 2. *Similarity or distance matric*
	 - How you measure similarity between two data points
	 - Example: *Euclidean distance* (straight-line distance between two points)
 3. *Cluster quality*
	 - How do you know if your clustering is good?
		 - *Intra-cluster cohesion*: points in a cluster are close together
		 - *Inter-cluster separation*: clusters are far apart
		 - Sometimes, human experts are still needed to judge if the clusters make sense


##### Evaluating Cluster Quality
 - There is no correct answer, but you can measure
	 - *Compactness* = how tight each cluster is
	 - *Separation* = how far clusters are from each other
	 - *Expert validation* = someone checks the result


##### Why it Matters?
 - Unsupervised learning helps:
	 - Explore new data
	 - Find hidden patterns humans might miss
	 - Prepare data for supervised models
 - It is used everywhere - from marketing and social media to biology, geography and cybersecurity
