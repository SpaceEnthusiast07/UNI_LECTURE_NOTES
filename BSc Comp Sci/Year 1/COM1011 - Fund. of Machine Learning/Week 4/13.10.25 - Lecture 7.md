##### Classification
 - ***Classification models*** predict categories (labels) based on continuous number inputs, unlike regression which predicts a continuous number.
- An example includes; a model taking input the luminosity (*continuous number input*) of an object and predicting if it is a star or not (the *category*).
- *Image Recognition* involves a model looking at a series of images of dogs and cats, and is tasked with *classifying (labelling)* which images contain dogs and which contain cats.
- ***Supervised Learning*** involves training a model on examples 

##### Logistic Regression
 - A type of classifier
