##### The Perceptron
 - A type of *classifier*
 - From the 1950s
 - "What is the best way to fit a straight line through the data to separate out the data?" ![[Pasted image 20251017103957.png]]
 - In 3 dimensions, it tries to fit a plane: ![[Pasted image 20251017104021.png]]
 - Stylised version of a perceptron: ![[Pasted image 20251017104344.png]]
	 - Weights: $(W_1)$
	 - $f$ is the function takes the parameter:
		 - $b$ is the bias
		 - $f$ is a step function, if the value of the parameter is above a threshold, the output is 1, else 0
$$
y = f(b + \sum_{i=0}^K w_i x_i)
$$


##### Training a Perceptron
![[Pasted image 20251017105019.png]]
 - Initialise all weights $w$ to $0$
 - Keep cycling through the data
 - For every $x$ try classifying it: $y^{pred} = f(wx + b)$
 - Update $w$: $w+{t+1} = w_t + \alpha (y^{data} - y^{pred}) x$
 - If the prediction is correct, $w$ is not updated
