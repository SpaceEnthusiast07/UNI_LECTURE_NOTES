***Pandas***:
 - Aids with data manipulation, analysis and visualisation
 - Can be used to create numerical tables and time series
 - Used to prepare data for machine learning
 - To use Pandas, you need to install it through the terminal; `pip install pandas`
 - To include it in a .py file; `import pandas as pd`
 - To read the data from a .csv file; `df = pd.read_csv("housing.csv")`
	 - `df` -> dataFrame, i.e. a table of data
	 - `pd` -> pandas class
	 - `read_csv()` -> function to read csv file
	 - `housing.csv` -> name of csv file to read


Libraries:
 - ***Pandas*** -> used for tabular data
 - ***NumPy*** -> the engine for numerical computing
 - ***Matplotlib*** -> the tool to visualise data


Why NumPy:
 - Efficient numerical computing in python
 - Fast array and matrix operations
 - Foundation for Pandas, scikit-learn, ***TensorFlow*** and ***PyTorch***


***NumPy***:
 - To install NumPy via the terminal; `pip install numpy`
 - To use in a .py file; `import numpy as np`
 - To create an array; `array = np.array([1,2,3])`
 - 1D Array -> known as a list/array
 - 2D Array -> known as a table or matrix
 - 3D Array -> ...
 - Declaration Structure:
	 - `array = np.array((2,3,3))`
	 - `(2,3,3)` -> this defines the array to have three dimensions
	 - `(no. rows/1st D, no. columns/2nd D, z-index/3rd D)` -> D = dimension
	 - I.e. this array has 2 rows, 3 columns and 3 tables (3 in the 3rd dimension)
 - Create a list of nums:
	 - To create a list of nums in one line use the `arange()` function
	 - `list = np.arange(0,10,1)`
	 - `0` = start number of list (inclusive)
	 - `10` = end number of list (non-inclusive)
	 - `1` = step between each number
	 - This code would generate the list: `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
	 - This is useful if you want to create a list of nums in one line
	 - Example:
		 - `list = np.arange(0,20,2)`
		 - This would create: `[0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18]`
 - Converting:
```
	# To convert a NumPy array to a python list use: array.tolist()
	numpyArray = np.array([1,2,3,4])
	list = numpyArray.tolist()
	print(list)
	-------------------------
	[1, 2, 3, 4]
	
	
	# To convert back:
	list = [1,2,3,4]
	array = np.array(list)
	print(array)
	-------------------------
	[1 2 3 4]
```
 - Differences with regular Python lists: ![[Pasted image 20250929114927.png]]
 - NumPy Array Properties:
	 - Shape
		 - `array.shape` returns the dimension structure of the array
		 - E.g. `(2,3)` meaning a 2d array with 2 rows and 3 columns
	 - Data Type
		 - `array.dtype` returns the data type of the array
		 - E.g. `int64` for a 64-bit integer
 - Indexing
	 - The process of accessing an element within the array
	 - `array[0]` -> accesses the first element
 - Slicing
	 - The process of accessing a sub-array from within the main array
	 - `array[1:4]` -> accesses elements 2 through 4 (inclusive) and returns a new array containing this data
 - Array Operations ![[Pasted image 20250929122359.png]]
	 - Operations are vectorised, applied to every element
 - Useful Functions
	 - `array.mean()` -> returns that average of the array
	 - `array.std()` -> returns the standard deviation
	 - `np.dot(array, array)` -> returns the dot product between the two arrays, i.e. the matrix multiplication of the two
	 - `array*array` -> element-wise multiplication


Matplotlib
 - Install using `pip install matplotlib`
 - Import using `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
 - To plot a line graph of `sin(x)`: ![[Pasted image 20250929124810.png]]
 - To plot a scatter graph of `sin(x)`: ![[Pasted image 20250929124957.png]]
 - Combine multiple graphs on the same plot: ![[Pasted image 20250929125109.png]]
