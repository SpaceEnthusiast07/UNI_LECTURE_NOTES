##### Binding
 - Binding refers to the linking of a method call to its body.
 - Binding links to polymorphism.
 - There are two types of binding:
 - **Static Binding**
	 - Happens on methods that cannot be overridden, i.e. with access modifiers; static, private, or final.
	 - ...
 - **Dynamic Binding**
	 - ...


##### Polymorphism
 - The mechanism of performing a single action in different ways.
 - Polymorphism is implemented through method overriding.
 - Example:
```java
public class Animal {
	// Private attributes
	// ...
	
	// Constructor
	// ...
	
	public void makeNoise() {
		// Do something generic
		System.out.prinln("Boo!"); 🤣
	}
	
	// Other methods
	// ...
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
	// Private attributes
	// ...
	
	// Constructor
	// ...
	
	public void makeNoise() {
		// Do something dog-like
		System.out.prinln("Woof!");
	}
	
	// Other methods
	// ...
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
	// Private attributes
	// ...
	
	// Constructor
	// ...
	
	public void makeNoise() {
		// Do something cat-like
		System.out.prinln("Meow!");
	}
	
	// Other methods
	// ...
}
```


##### Abstract Classes
 - As you may have noticed in the above example, if someone calls the `makeNoise()` method from the `Animal` class, what noise do you make?
 - This is where `abstract` classes come in.
 - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, only their child classes can be.
 - Then, within this class, you can define any methods you want, but you don't provide any instructions within the method body.
 - This is useful in the scenario above, where the `makeNoise()` method in the `Animal` class doesn't make sense logically, so `Animal` can be made abstract and the `makeNoise()` method can also be made abstract.
 - An **abstract method** is one *without an implementation*.
 - An abstract class may not have any abstract methods.
 - Example:
```java
// Abstract Class
public abstract class Animal {
	// ...
	
	// Format of an abstract method
	public abstract void makeNoise();
}

// Regular child class
public class Dog extends Animal {
	// ...
	
	// Now, define the method for the type Dog
	public void makeNoise() {
		System.out.println("Woof!");
	}
}
```

>[! Warning] Calling something like `Animal.makeNoise();` will result in a compiler error!


##### Abstract Rules
 - If a class contains an abstract method, it must be declared as abstract.
 - If a class extends an abstract class, then:
	 - All abstract methods must be defined in the subclass.
	 - Or, the subclass is defined as abstract itself.


##### Abstraction
 - **Abstraction** is the concept of *hiding/removing all but relevant data* in order to *reduce complexity* and *increase efficiency*.
 - Encapsulation is a kind of abstraction.
 - Abstract classes achieve partial abstraction.
 - Interfaces achieve full abstraction (almost). 🤣


##### Interfaces
 - It is sometimes useful to *define* what a class *must do*, but *not how to do it*.
 - That is what an interface is, a fully abstract class, containing only abstract methods.
 - Therefore, when a class *implements* an interface, it must provide its own implementation of the methods defined in the interface.
 - This diagram shows which keyword is used depending on the context: ![[Pasted image 20260212152648.png]]
 - A single class can only extend on class at a time, but it can implement more than one interface at a time.


##### Defining an Interface
 - It has *no constructors*.
 - It only contains public, static and final attributes.
 - It can only contain public and abstract methods.
 - Since Java 8, you can have static and default methods.


##### Default Methods
 - When a parent type (class or interface) defines a default method, one of three things happen:
	 1. Override the default method like normal.
	 2. Declare the method again with no body, i.e. making it abstract.
	 3. Or, no mention means it is simply inherited as usual.


##### Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces
 - Similarities:
	 - Both cannot be directly instantiated.
	 - Both can include abstract methods.
	 - Both are usually used to define what you want doing, but leave the actual implementation to the subclasses.
 - Differences:
	 - Constructors ... as mentioned above
	 - Attributes ... as mentioned above
	 - Methods ... as mentioned above


##### Rule of Thumb
 - Always use interfaces.
 - "Program to an interface, not an implementation."
 - The separation of interface and implementation enables better software design and ease in expansion.
