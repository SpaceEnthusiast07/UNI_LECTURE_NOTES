##### What is an Exception?
 - An **exception** is an *abnormal event* that arises *during the execution* of the program.
 - They disrupt the regular flow of the program.
 - When an error occurs in an Java program, an *Exception object* is automatically generated.


##### Resolving an Exception
 - Also known as exception handling.
 - There is a mechanism in Java known as a `try-catch-finally` block.
 - If an exception occurs in the `try` block, the program automatically jumps to one of the `catch` blocks.
 - You can have more than one `catch` block, where each *catches* a specific exception, or you can have one that captures a *general exception*.
 - You can also have a block called `finally`. This block is always executed no matter what happens during the `try` block.
 - If you have a `try` block, you must have at least one `catch` block. However, the `finally` block is optional.
 - Example:
```java
public class TryCatchApp {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			// Division examples
			System.out.println(" -> 6/2 = " + (6/2));
			System.out.println(" -> 6/0 = " + (6/0));
		}
		catch (ArithmeticException e) {
			System.out.println("Division by 0 exception!!");
		}
		finally {
			System.out.println("Finished the try-catch block.");
		}
	}
}
```

##### Exception Categorisation
Java exception classes are categorised into:
 - **Unchecked Exceptions**
	 - These exceptions are not checked during compile time.
	 - This means that may occur during execution.
	 - E.g. `ArithmeticException`.
 - **Checked Exceptions**
	 - These exceptions are checked at compile time.
	 - This means, the compiler will inform you that you need to implement a try-catch block to safely handle the exception.
	 - E.g. `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException`.

##### Unchecked Exceptions
 - Any exception that is a sub class of the `RuntimeException` will not be checked by the compiler.

| RuntimeException                 | Example                                            | Explanation                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ArithmeticException`            | `int a = 2/0;`                                     | Division by 0.                                                    |
| `NullPointerException`           | `Rectangle r;`<br>`r.getWidth();`                  | `r` doesn't point to a memory address.                            |
| `NumberFormatException`          | `int i = Integer.parseInt("book");`                | You cannot convert a word into an integer.                        |
| `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` | `int[] anArray = new int[3];`<br>`anArray[3] = 4;` | For this array, the indices are `[0,1,2]`, so 3 is out of bounds. |
| There are many more exceptions.  | ...                                                | ...                                                               |
 - When an exception occurs, you have two options: do nothing, or handle it using `try-catch` blocks.

##### Checked Exceptions
 - Any exception that is *not a sub class* of the `RuntimeException` exception is checked at compile time.
 - E.g. `IOException`, `FileNotFoundException`, `SQLException`, etc.
 - With checked exceptions, you can choose not to handle them, and pass them onto the next method in the call stack.
 - To do this, ensure the keyword `throws` is used in the method signature to indicate that this method may throw a given exception.


##### Exception Propagation
 - When a method throws an exception, the JVM searches backward through the call stack for a matching exception handler. ![[Pasted image 20260217131517.png]]
 - If a handler is found, the rest of the code is executed normally.
 - Else, if a handler is not found, the JVM will print out the stack trace, exception type, and will then terminate the program.
