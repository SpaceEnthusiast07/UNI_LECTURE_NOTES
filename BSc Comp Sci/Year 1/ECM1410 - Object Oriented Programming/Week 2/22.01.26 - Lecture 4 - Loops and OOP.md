##### What are Loops
 - A ***loop*** allows us to *repeat* a block of statements for a set number of times or while a condition is true.
 - ***For Loop***:
	 - This type of loop repeats the code block a certain number of times.
	 - Structure: `for (initialiser, end condition, incrementer) {}`.
	 - The ***initialiser*** sets the starting value for the *iteration counter*, usually called `i`.
	 - The ***end condition*** sets the end/last value in the range of values for `i`.
	 - The ***incrementer*** sets how the iteration counter is changed at the end of each loop. E.g. `i++` to increment, or `i-=2` to decrement by $2$.
	 - E.g.
```java
// Define an array to loop over
int[] myArray = [45, 72, 1, 29, 201, 28];

// Use a for loop to loop through each element in the array
for (int i = 0; i < myArray.Length; i++) {
	System.out.println("Item " + (i+1) + ": " + myArray[i]);
}

-- OUTPUT -----------------------------------------------------------
Item 1: 45
Item 2: 72
Item 3: 1
Item 4: 29
Item 5: 201
Item 6: 28
```
 - ***For-Each loop***:
	 - It is a simpler version for a for loop that allows you to iterate over each element in an array, or any collection of data.
	 - Structure: `for (Type variable : array) {}`.
	 - The type of the variable must be the same as the type of the array.
	 - Now, at each iteration, the variable holds the value in the array that corresponds to the iteration number.
	 - E.g.
```java
// Define an array
int[] myArray = [45, 72, 1, 29, 201, 28];

System.out.println("For-Each Loop:");
// For each loop
for (int number : myArray) {
	System.out.println("Array Item : " + (number));
}

System.out.println("For Loop:");
// This for each loop can be converted into a regular for loop
for (int i = 0; i < myArray.Length; i++) {
	System.out.println("Array Item : " + (myArray[i]));
}

-- OUTPUT -----------------------------------------------------------
For-Each Loop:
Array Item: 45
Array Item: 72
Array Item: 1
Array Item: 29
Array Item: 201
Array Item: 28
For Loop:
Array Item: 45
Array Item: 72
Array Item: 1
Array Item: 29
Array Item: 201
Array Item: 28
```
 - ***While Loop***:
	 - Allows you to repeat a code block while a condition is true.
	 - Structure: `while (condition) {}`.
	 - This means that the code block may never be executed, because the condition could be false before it even starts.
 - ***Do-While Loop***:
	 - Allows you to repeat a code block while a condition is true.
	 - Structure: `do {} while (condition)`.
	 - *Warning*: Since the condition is at the end, the code block will always be executed at least once.


##### Break and Continue Keywords
 - ***Break***: This keyword allows you to prematurely exit any type of loop, before the final iteration.
 - ***Continue***: This keyword stops the *current* loop iteration and restarts with the *next loop iteration*.


##### Break and Continue Labels
 - Using break or continue on there own, only effects the loop that that statement is within, it does not effect the outer loop in a nested loop situation.
 - You can label a loop and break or continue that particular loop.
 - E.g.
```java
first: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
		System.out.println("i:" + (i) + "  j:" + (j));
		if (j > i) break first;
	}
}
```


##### Object Oriented Basics
 - ***Class***:
	 - This is like a *blueprint* for a real world object.
	 - A class can have ***attributes***, which are *properties of that class*, like the name or age of a person.
	 - Classes can also have ***methods***, which define its *behaviour*, such as `Dog.Bark();` which could print "Woof woof!" to the screen or play a dog barking sound.
 - ***Object***:
	 - An object is an *instance* of a *class*.
	 - I.e. it is one particular version of that class with its own set of attributes.
	 - Example:
		 - You could have a class that represents a dog, with attributes; "name", "age", "breed", etc., and methods like "bark", "walk", "run", "eat", etc.
		 - Then one particular object would be my dog named "Simon" who is a "Golden Labrador" and is "5" years old.
		 - Then, another object (instance of the class dog) could be some else's dog name "Willow" who is a "Sheep dog" and aged "4".
	 - You can have as many instances of one particular class as you want.


##### Procedural vs. Objects
![[Pasted image 20260122171719.png]]
 - ***Procedural Oriented Programming (POP)***:
	 - Focuses on *procedures/functions* as the *basic unit*.
	 - The computation is modelled as a *sequence of procedural (one after the other) transformations to data*.
 - ***Object Oriented Programming (OOP)***:
	 - Focuses on components that the user understands, with objects as the basic unit.
	 - Involves a higher level of abstraction used to solve real life problems.
	 - Aims to make software reusable/modular and the design and maintenance easier.


#### OOP Pillars
 - These are the four pillars that make up Object Oriented Programs.


##### Encapsulation (The Protective Shell)
 - It is the practice of bundling data (variables) and the methods (functions) that act on this data into a single unit called a class.
 - It also involves "hiding" the internal state of an object from the outside world.
 - You use the `private` keyword to declare which variables are hidden from the outside world.
 - You then declare `public` methods, called `getters` and `setters`, that perform safe, controlled and intended operations on this data.
 - These methods can allow the outside world to read some data but not alter its value.
 - This avoids accidental data corruption and makes code easier to maintain because you know where the data is being changed.


##### Abstraction (The Simple Interface)
 - Abstraction is about hiding the complex background details and showing only the necessary features to the user.
 - It helps reduce the complexity by letting the programmer focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.
 - You create simple interfaces or abstract classes that define the rules without worrying about the messy implementation details.
 - It allows developers to work with high level concepts without getting bogged down by the under the hood mechanics.


##### Inheritance (The Family Tree)
 - Inheritance allows one class (the child class) to acquire the properties and behaviours of another class (the parent class).
 - This pillar promotes reusability.
 - Example:
	 - Say you have defined an `Animal` class with behaviours such as `eat()` and `sleep()`.
	 - Then you create a child `Dog` class that automatically inherits all the behaviours and variables (like `sleep()` and `eat()`).
	 - Then, this new child `Dog` class can implement its own behaviours and variables, such as `bark()`.
 - This means you can save time and complexity because you do not have to rewrite the same code for every new object, you just build upon what already exists.


##### Polymorphism (The Many Forms)
 - Polymorphism comes from the Greek words meaning "many shapes".
 - It allows for different classes to be treated as if they are the same type, but each responds to the same command in its own way.
 - Example:
	 - Going back to the example in the Inheritance section.
	 - Say the `Animal` class had a method called `makeSound()`.
	 - When you make a child `Dog` or `Cat` class, you can override the functionality of this method, to say "Woof woof!" in the `Dog` class and "Meow!" in the `Cat` class.
 - This means that you can call the same method and pass in the same parameters to different objects and they will respond in their own way.
 - This pillar allows for flexibility, where you can write one piece of code that works with a variety of different objects without needing to know exactly which one it is at the time.
