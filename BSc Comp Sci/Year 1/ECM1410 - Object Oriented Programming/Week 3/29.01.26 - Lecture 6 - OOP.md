##### Creating and Using Objects
 - There are three steps required to create an object in Java:
	 - **Declaration**: Associating a variable name with an object type, e.g. `Rectangle myRect;`.
	 - **Instantiation**: Using the `new` keyword to allocate a block of memory for the object, e.g. `Rectangle myRect = new;`.
	 - **Initialisation**: Following the `new` keyword with a call to a constructor to set the object's initial values, e.g. `Rectangle myRect = new Rectangle();`.
 - To interact with the object's attributes or methods after creation, you use the dot operator (`.`).
 - For example, `myRect.getArea();` calls a method and `myRect.width` accesses an attribute.


##### Object References
 - *Warning!* A variable for an object *doesn't hold the object itself*, it holds *a reference* (a memory address) to where the object is stored.
 - Example:
	 - If you set `rect2 = rect1`, both variables now point to the exact same object in memory.
	 - Therefore, changes via `rect2` will be visible when looking at `rect1`, because they point to the same data.


##### Encapsulation (Hiding Data)
 - Encapsulation is one of the *core features of OOP*.
 - It is the practice of *"wrapping" data* (attributes) and the code that acts on it (*methods*) into a *single unit* (class).
 - To achieve encapsulation in Java:
	 - **Private Fields**: Declare all attributes as `private` so they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
	 - **Getters and Setters**: Provide `public` methods to allow other classes to "view" or "modify" these attributes in a controlled way.
 - *Advantages*: It enforces *modularity*, improves *maintainability*, and allows a class to have *total control over its fields* (e.g. making a field read-only by removing a setter method).


##### Copying Objects: Shallow vs. Deep
 - **Copy Constructors** allow you to create a *new object* using an *existing object* of the same type as a *template*.
 - There are two types of copying:
 - **Shallow Copy**:
	 - A **shadow copy** creates a new *container object*, but it does *not create new versions* of the objects inside it.
	 - It just copies the references to those internal objects.
	 - Example:
		 - A `Patient` object has a `Heart` object.
		 - A shallow copy of `Patient` results in a new `Patient` object, but both point to (use) the exact same `Heart` instance.
		 - Consequence: If you change the copied `Patient`'s heart (e.g. the heart rate), you also change the original `Patient`'s heart.
 - **Deep Copy**: 
	 - A **deep copy** creates a completely *independent* duplicate.
	 - It creates a new container and new instances of every object inside it.
	 - Example:
		 - To deep copy a `Patient`, the constructor creates a `new Heart` by calling a copy constructor from the `Heart` class.
		 - Therefore, the newly constructed patient's heart refers to a different instance from the patient it was copied from.
		 - Consequence: The two objects are completely disconnected. Changing the data in one doesn't effect the other.


##### Keywords
 - `private`  - Makes a member accessible only within its own class, meaning that other instances can access this data.
 - `protected` - Makes a member accessible within its own package and by subclasses in other packages.
 - `this` - A reference to the current object instance. It is used to distinguish between class attributes and method parameters with the same name (e.g. `this.width = width;`) or to call one constructor from another.
