##### Class Properties
 - A class consists of *members*:
 - ***Attributes (Fields)***: These define the *state of the object*. For example, a `Rectangle` class may have attributes `width` and `height`.
 - ***Methods***: These are sets of instructions that perform specific tasks or define the *behaviours of an object*. For example, a `getArea()` method calculates the area using the rectangle's attributes `height` and `width`.
 - ***Constructors***: These are *special blocks of code invoked at the time of object creation*, which are used to *initialise the object's data* (attributes). A constructors name must *exactly match the class name*.
 - ***Destructors***: Java doesn't have destructors since it has a garbage collector that cleans up for the programmer.


##### Java Class Syntax
 - This example is for a class representing a rectangle.
```java
// Class definition structure
public class Rectangle {
	// Attributes
	public double width;
	public double height;
	
	// Constructor
	public Rectangle(double w, double h) {
		// This is what typically happens
		// inside the constructor
		width = w
		height = h
	}
	
	// Methods
	public double getArea() {
		return width * height;
	}
}
```


##### Naming Conventions
 - ***Classes***: Each word starts with an uppercase letter. E.g. BouncingBall, HelloWorld, ParetoArchive, etc.
 - ***Methods and Attributes***: Each word starts with an uppercase, but the first word starts with a lowercase letter. E.g. width, originX, borrowDate. For methods, e.g. brake, addValueToArchive, resetButton.


##### Instance vs. Static Members
 - ***Instance Members***:
	 - These belong to *specific objects*.
	 - Each `Rectangle` object that is created has its own unique `width` and `height`.
 - ***Static (Class-Level) Members***:
	 - These belong to the class as a whole and are *shared by all instances*.
	 - Memory is allocated only once for static members when the class is loaded.
	 - You do not need to create an instance of a class to access static (class level) members.
	 - A static attribute *can change*, and this change is immediately reflected across all objects, since only one copy exits in memory and all objects can access this copy.


##### Key Method Concepts
 - ***Method Overloading***:
	 - Java allows you to have *multiple methods with the same name* as long as they have *different parameters* (whether that be data type or number).
	 - You *cannot overload* a method based *only on the return type*.
 - ***Default Values***:
	 - Attributes within a class are given default values; `0` for `int`, `false` for `boolean`, and `null` for objects.
	 - However, local variables declared inside methods have no default values and must be initialised before use.


##### Full Java Class Example
```java
// Define a bike class
public class Bike {
	// Regular attributes
	private int cadence;
	private int speed;
	private int gear;
	// Instance attribute for the bike id
	private int id;
	// A static attribute used to keep
	// track of the number of bikes
	private static int numberOfBikes;
	
	// Constructor
	public Bike (int cd = 90, int sp = 12, int gr = 8) {
		cadence = cd;
		speed = sp;
		gear = gr;
		// Increment the number of bikes
		++numberOfBikes;
		// Set the id to the new number of bikes
		id = numberOfBikes;
	}
	
	publlic int getID() {
		return id;
	}
	
	public static int getNumberOfBikes() {
		return numberOfBikes;
	}
}

public class BikeApp {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Create 3 new bike objects
		Bike b1 = new Bike(99, 10, 9);
		Bike b2 = new Bike(87, 15, 1);
		Bike b3 = new Bike(90, 12, 2);
		
		// Output the id for each new bike object
		System.out.println("b1.id: " + b1.getID());
		System.out.println("b2.id: " + b2.getID());
		System.out.println("b3.id: " + b3.getID());
		
		// Output the number of bikes
		System.out.println("Number of Bikes: " + Bike.getNumberOfBikes());
	}
}

-- OUTPUT -----------------------------------------------------------
b1.id: 1
b2.id: 2
b3.id: 3
Number of Bikes: 3
```


##### Keywords Explained
 - `new` - to instantiate a new object from a class blueprint.
 - `this` - refers to the current instance of the object.
