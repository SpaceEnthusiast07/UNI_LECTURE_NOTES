##### Data Attributes
 - An ***address*** is a location within main memory where this data is located.
 - A ***data type*** describes what type of data is located at this address and what operations are allowed to be performed on this data.
 - All data is represented as a ***bit string*** (list of 0s and 1s), so the program uses the data type to interpret this bit string as a character or integer (for example).
	 - Since a single bit string can be represented as many different pieces of data, the data type is used to choose which interpretation.
 - All data is assigned an ***identifier***. This is used to reference the data without having to remember the exact memory address.


##### Data Declarations
 - ***Data declaration*** refers to the process of defining a data item.
 - In Java, e.g. `int age;`.
 - Java is ***strictly typed***, meaning that the programmer must *specify the data type* of the variable during the declaration.
 - This ensures errors are caught from performing the incorrect operation on that specific data type.


##### Primitive Data Types
 - A ***primitive data type*** is a fundamental data type that is made up of nothing else.
 - Integer types
	 - `byte` = 8 bits
	 - `short` = 16 bits
	 - `int` = 32 bits
	 - `long` = 64 bits
 - Floating point types (decimal)
	 - `float` = 32 bits
	 - `double` = 64 bits
 - Character type (Unicode)
	 - `char` = 16 bits
 - Boolean type (`true` or `false`)
	 - `boolean` = 1 bit
 - All other data types are ***object references*** (memory addresses) to 32 or 64 bits, depending on the computer's architecture.

##### Literals
 - ***Literals*** are *raw data*, e.g. `int age = 20;` and not `int age = 10 + 10;`. In this declaration, `20` is a literal value, no calculations nor look ups required.
 - For integer literals (byte, short, int, long)
	 - decimal: 197, -56, 12_345_678 (_ can be used to visually separate the numbers)
	 - octal (base 8): 036 (octals start with a 0)
	 - hexadecimal (base 16): 0x1a, 0X3E1 (started with 0x or 0X)
	 - binary (base 2): 0b11010, 0B1011 (started with 0b or 0B)
	 - Not allowed: 137,879 (comma not allowed)
	 - The suffix L or l is used to indicate a type of `long`, L is preferred for readability
 - For char literals
	 - Since the char type is a numeric type (e.g. ASCII table), this means that arithmetic operators are allowed
	 - Allowed: 'B', '.', '\u5469'
	 - Special characters:
		 - '\n' = newline
		 - '\t' = tab (4 spaces)
		 - '\\\\' = single backslash
		 - '\\'' = single quote
		 - '\\"' = double quote
 - Floating point literals
	 - Allowed: 6.67, 0.1e+3f, 7e5, 4.5E-19, 1E-9f, 1e4D
		 - D or d represents double type


##### Floating Point Accuracy
 - Since you have a limited number of bits to represent any given decimal in a given range, it is common for that decimal to not be represented correctly and therefore have rounding errors.
 - Example:
	 - Multiply 29.0 by 0.01 = 0.29
	 - Then multiply by 100 = 28.99999999998 (for example)


##### Variables
 - A ***variable*** refers to a *named storage location* that stores a value of a particular data type.
 - The value of a variable *can change* during the execution of the program.
 - A variable has an *identifier* (name), *data type* (e.g. int or String), and stores a *value* of the declared type.
```java
// Variable to hold users age
int age = 20;

// Variable for keeping track of stock
decimal appleStockPrice
```


##### Naming Conventions
 - In Java all names use camel-case.
 - Classes start with an uppercase letter, e.g. `public class Person {}`.
 - Methods start with a lower-case, e.g. `int calculateCircleArea(int radius) {}`.
 - Variable also start with a lower-case, e.g. `int cowCounter = 4;`


##### Constants
 - A constant is a variable, but the value cannot change during the execution of the program.
 - In Java the keyword `final` is used before the data type in the variable declaration.
 - All constant names must be all upper-case and with words separated by an underscore.
```java
// Variable to hold the number of cows entering a field
int numberOfCows = 10;

// Constant to hold the amount of tax
final float TAX = 0.2f;
```


##### Casting
 - ***Casting*** (primitive conversion) refers to the process of *changing a variable's data type*.
 - There are two types of casting:![[Pasted image 20260115212522.png]]
 - ***Widening***
	 - This is implicit (no keyword required to cast).
	 - 'Widening' = widening the range the value can lie within.
	 - Happens left to right in the sequence above.
	 - E.g., if you convert a byte to an int, the bit string for the byte type can be copied over to the int and the leading bits are 0s.
	 - Example: `short a = 20;` then `long b = a;`.
 - ***Narrowing***
	 - This is explicit (a keyword is required to cast).
	 - 'Narrowing' = the range is narrowing.
	 - Happens right to left in the sequence above.
	 - Cannot always be done, if you have `short miles = 200;`, `byte casted_miles = miles;` would result in an error since a byte only supports numbers between -127 and 128.
	 - Example: `short a = 20;` then `byte b = a;`, works since 20 is within the range for byte.


##### Overflow
 - ***Overflow*** is the process of some data growing *beyond its designated boundaries*.
 - Example: since a byte can store numbers between -127 and 128, the number 130 would result in an overflow error since it has grown outside the permitted range.
