##### What is a Programming Language?
 - A ***programming language*** is a set of instructions that allow humans to communicate with computers.
 - Each programming language has its own *syntax* (similar to grammar in English)
 - If the syntax is broken in anyway, the program *fails to execute*
 - ***Syntax*** is the *grammatical* rules and *structural patterns* governing the ordered use of *key words* and symbols for issuing commands, writing code, etc.
 - ***Key words*** are certain words reserved by the programming language that have a specific meaning within this language. They cannot be used as variable names, etc.
 - ***Semantics*** refers to the meaning (or interpretation of the meaning) of a word, sign, sentence, etc.


##### High vs Low Level Languages
 - Languages are often categorised by how close they are to English versus machine code (raw binary):
 - ***High Level***
	 - These languages read more like *English*.
	 - They use key words like `if`, `while`, `print`.
	 - They require a *translator* (*compiler or interpreter*) to convert the instructions into *machine code* (binary), so the computer *can execute* the instructions.
	 - A few examples of high level languages are Python, Java, C++, C#.
	 - Tend to be slower than low level languages.
 - ***Low level***
	 - These read *less like English* and use sophisticated symbols to represent instructions.
	 - These do not require a translator to convert to machine code (an assembler in the case of assembly code)
	 - They give *more precise control over the hardware* of a computer.
	 - Assembly and machine code are considered low level languages.
	 - C is sometimes considered a low level language, but sometimes a mid level language since it requires a translator.
	 - Tend to be *much faster than high level* languages.


##### Translators
 - All high level languages must be translated into machine code for the computer to execute.
 - There are three types of high level languages:
 - ***Compiled***
	 - A ***compiler*** translates the *entire* program into machine code *before* execution.
	 - ***Platform Dependence*** - The resulting executable is specific to the platform that it has been compiled to.
	 - Examples of compiled languages are C, C++, Rust.
 - ***Interpreted***
	 - An ***interpreter*** translates *line-by-line* during execution.
	 - These languages are *generally slower* because if the program contains any code within a *loop* or that needs to be executed *multiple times*, this code is *re-interpreted* every time.
	 - Some examples of interpreted languages include; R, PHP, Perl, MATLAB.
 - ***Compiled and Interpreted***
	 - Firstly, the program is compiled to *byte code*.
	 - ***Byte code*** is a *low level*, *platform-independent* representation of the program. It is the halfway point between *source code* and machine code.
		 - Byte code looks like gibberish to humans and cannot be executed by the computer.
	 - ***Source code*** is another name for the program you write.
	 - Then, at run time, a *virtual machine* *interprets* this byte code into the specific machine code instructions.
	 - A ***virtual machine*** is a *software-based* "fake" computer that runs on top of your real computer. Its only job is to *interpret the byte code* into machine code.


##### Programming Paradigms
 - A ***paradigm*** is like the *style*, *philosophy*, or *mindset* for how code should be structured and how problems should be solved. It isn't just about the syntax, but about the *mental model* used to approach the logic.
 - There are several paradigms organised into a tree structure:
 - ***Imperative***
	 - These are traditional *recipe* style programs, you tell the computer *how* to solve a problem, *step-by-step*.
	 - Within imperative, you have two more; ***Procedural*** (e.g. C) and ***Object Oriented*** (Java, C++).
 - ***Declarative***
	 - In these programs, you describe the *desired result* or the logic of the computation *without explicitly listing the step-by-step commands*.
	 - Within declarative, you have two more; ***Functional*** (e.g. Haskell) and ***Logic*** (e.g. Prolog).


#### Java
##### History
 - The language was originally developed by *James Gosling* and Sun Microsystems.
 - Sun Microsystems is now owned by Oracle since 2010.
 - Gosling named the language *Oak* after the oak tree he could see outside his office window.
 - Oak was intended for *small*, *embedded systems* in electronic appliances, such as set-top boxes.
 - ***Embedded Systems*** are designed around a *single focus*, such as a heart monitor in a hospital, the computer in a microwave, dishwasher or washing machine.
 - Java is *not an acronym*, the name comes form an island of Indonesia where the first coffee was produced.


##### Running a Java Program
![[Pasted image 20260113150912.png]]
 - The java source code is written within a `.java` file.
 - This `.java` file is passed into the `javac` compiler, which compiles it to *byte code*, with the extension `.class`.
 - Then, the *Java Virtual Machine (JVM)*, which is built for different platforms, *interprets* the byte code at run time.


##### Java Virtual Machine
![[Pasted image 20260113154523.png]]
 - The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is like a "hypothetical computer" which Java runs on.
 - This means that the instructions are not executed directly on the computer, they are executed in the JVM then the JVM performs the instruction through the OS.
 - This means that Java is fully platform independent (write once, run anywhere (WORA)) and secured.
 - The JVM acts to isolate the Java program from the OS it is executed on.


##### Write and Run a Java Program
 - *Step 1*: Create the source code file - `HelloWorld.java`.
	 - Whenever JVM executes a program, it first looks for the `main()` method.
	 - This means that not all classes are executable.
```java
// A Java program that outputs the message
// "Hello World!" to the command line
// Class name must match file name
public class HelloWorld {
	// The main method is the entire point for this program
	// Arguments can be passed into the program via "String[] args"
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// This is a statement and must be terminated with a semicolon
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```
 - *Step 2*: Compile the program using `javac`.
	 - If successful, this produces a `HelloWorld.class` file.
	 - This `.class` file contains Java byte code.
```
>> javac HelloWorld.java
```
 - *Step 3*: Execute the program using `java`.
	 - The `java` command is used to invoke the *JVM*.
	 - As long as the `java` command is called within the directory containing the `HelloWorld.class` file, the JVM only needs `HelloWorld`. Otherwise, the full system path to the `.class` file is required.
```
>> java HelloWorld

-- OUTPUT -----------------------------------------------------------
Hello World!
```


##### Java Program Structure
 - The start and end of code blocks is denoted by *curly braces* `{}`.
 - Each instruction or *statement is terminated* using a *semi colon* `;`.
 - Therefore, indentation and line breaks are only there to aid the human reading the code, the java compiler doesn't care.
 - However, it is not recommended to remove all indentation and line breaks, etc.
