##### What is an Array?
 - An **array** object is an object which contains a *collection of elements* of the *same data type* that are stored in *contiguous memory*. ![[Pasted image 20260205143308.png]]
 - An **index** is used to *access the data* stored at a particular location.
 - Indices are *0-based*, i.e. start at 0 and increment by 1 for each subsequent element.
 - Since indices are 0-based, the last index is equal to the length of the array - 1.
 - If the data type of the array is *primitive* (e.g. `int`, `boolean`, `double`) the data stored at each location is the *primitive data*.
 - However, if the data type is a *reference type* (e.g. `String`, `Person`) the data held at each element is a *reference to the object in memory*.


##### Creating an Array Object
 - To create an array, there are three steps:
 - **Declaration**
	 - Declare a new variable with the desired data type.
	 - E.g. `String[] names;`
 - **Instantiation**
	 - Use the `new` keyword to allocate a block of memory for the array.
	 - E.g. `names = new String[2]`.
	 - In this example, the array length is 2.
 - **Initialisation**
	 - The process of assigning a value to each element of the array.
	 - E.g.
		 - `names[0] = "Alex";`
		 - `names[1] = "Oliver";`
 - There is several different combinations that you can use:
 - You can either perform the three steps in one go: 
	 - E.g. `String[] names = {"Alex", "Oliver"};`.
 - You could just declare an empty array:
	 - E.g. `String[] names = new String[5];` -> 5 `null` elements.
 - You could also do:
	 - E.g. `String[] names;`
	 - `names = new String[]{"Alex", "Oliver"}`


##### Exercise
![[Pasted image 20260205145042.png]]
My answer:
```java
Rectangle[] rects = {new Rectangle(10,5), new Rectangle()};
```
My answer is *correct*, you could have appended `new Rectangle[]` just before the start of the curly braces.


##### Multi-dimensional Arrays
 - We can have more than 1 dimensional arrays.
 - 2 dimensional arrays are tables or matrices.
	 - E.g. `int[][] matrix = new int[7][5]; // 7 rows, 5 columns`
 - 3 or more dimensional arrays are less common, but more common with machine learning and AI.
 - To create a 3 dimensional array, use 3 pairs of square brackets
	 - E.g. `int[][][] 3dArray = new int[4][6][2];`.
 - To access an element in a multi-dimensional array, the syntax is as follows: `2dArray[<rowIndex>][<columnIndex>] = <value>;`


##### Java ArrayList
 - The problem with regular arrays is that they are *fixed length*.
 - We can change the values at particular elements (as long as it is of the same data type), but the *length is immutable* (cannot change).
 - To use ArrayList, use the following command: `import java.utils.ArrayList;`
 - To create an ArrayList of String objects:
	 - `ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();`
 - `ArrayList<E>` is a generic class: `E` could be any class type.


##### ArrayList Methods
 - Adding objects:
	 - `names.add("Alex");`
 - Get the length:
	 - `int numberOfNames = names.size();`
 - Read the i-th element:
	 - `String name = names.get(i);`
 - Remove the i-th element:
	 - `names.remove(i);`
 - There are more methods, a full list can be found at: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html


##### Inheritance
 - In Object Oriented languages, classes can be derived from other classes, thereby *inheriting fields and methods* from those classes.
 - I.e., a derived/child class has access to every attribute and method from its parent class, respecting the access modifiers.
 - The term *superclass* (base) refers to the parent class of a given class.
 - The term *subclass* (derived) refers to the child class of a given class.
 - We use inheritance because it promotes code reusability and better program structure.
 - To create a class that inherits from another class, you use the `extends` keyword.
 - E.g. `class SubClassName extends SuperClassName {}`


##### Single Inheritance
 - Java only supports single inheritance - i.e. each subclass can have only one direct superclass.
 - I.e., class C cannot inherit from class A and B at the same time, it must inherit from class B and class B inherits from class A.
 - Diagram to show acceptable inheritance: ![[Pasted image 20260205151928.png]]


##### Access Modifiers
 - **Access modifiers** control the *level of access* other classes have to the attributes and methods of another class, kind of self descriptive 🤣😁.
 - Table to show the behaviour of each access modifier keyword: ![[Pasted image 20260205152356.png]]
	 - Yes = can access
	 - No = cannot access
 - A *subclass* will *inherit* all `public` and `protected` attributes and methods *no matter what*.
 - If the *subclass* is within the *same package* as its parent class, it will also *inherit* the `default (package-private)` attributes and methods.


##### Method Overriding
 - This concept is similar but different to method overloading.
 - **Method Overloading** is the process of having *multiple methods* of the *same name* but a *different* number/type of *arguments*.
 - **Method Overriding** is the process of keeping the *exact same method signature* as the *parent class*, but *changing the functionality*.
 - With method overriding, you *can widen the access* (i.e. make it public from private), but you *cannot narrow the access* (i.e. make is private from public).


##### Static Methods
 - Static methods can be *inherited*.
 - Static methods *cannot be overridden*.
 - You *cannot change* an *instance method* from a parent class *to a static method* in the child class.


##### Super Keyword
 - This keyword can be used within a child class to *specifically call a method or reference an attribute from the parent class*.
 - E.g.: Call the parent's constructor from the child class
```java
public class Dog extends Animal {
	public Dog(String colour, int age, int collarSize) {
		super(colour, age); // Call the parent class' constructor
		this.collarSize = collarSize;
	}
}
```
