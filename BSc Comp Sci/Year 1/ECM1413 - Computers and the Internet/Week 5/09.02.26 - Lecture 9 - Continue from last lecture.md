*Note*: This lecture goes through the rest of pipelining hazards.

##### Control Hazard
 - Arises from branches and instructions that change the PC (Program Counter).
 - Performance losses are greater than data hazards.
 - If a branch changes the PC (Program Counter) to its target address, it is called a **taken branch**.
	 - I.e. if a branch changes where the PC points, it is known as a taken branch.
 - Obviously 🤣, if a branch does not change the PC, it is known as an untaken branch.
 - Generally, the PC is incremented by the word size (usually 32-bits or 4 bytes), and points to the next instruction to be fetched.
 - If a branch operation depends on the result from a previous operation, then this branch must be delayed (makes sense!! 🤣), and is called a **delayed branch**.
