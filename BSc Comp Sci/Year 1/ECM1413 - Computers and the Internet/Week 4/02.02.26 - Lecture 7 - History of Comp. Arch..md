##### High Level Language to Hardware
 - Applications are written in millions of lines of complex instructions.
 - Hardware can only execute a predefined set of simple instructions.


##### Performance Design Enhancements
 - Shared memory architecture
 - Cache memory architecture
 - Pipelined execution
 - Out of order execution
 - Speculative execution
 - Branch prediction
 - Compiler optimisations
 - Data/instruction de-duplication
 - Specialised hardware accelerators
 - Virtual memory


##### Classes of Computers
 - Personal Mobile Devices (PMDs)
	 - Wireless
	 - Multimedia interface
	 - E.g. smartphones and tablets
	 - Constraints
		 - Cost
		 - Energy efficiency
		 - Size requirements
		 - Responsiveness and predictability
 - Desktop
 - Servers
	 - Large scale
	 - More reliable
	 - Features: Availability (available 24/7), scalability (add more power), and throughput (amount of work per unit time)
	 - Constraints
		 - Avoid downtime (no availability)
		 - Up front cost is high
 - Cluster/warehouse scale computers
	 - software as a service
 - Embedded computers
	 - In everyday machines
	 - E.g. microwaves, washing machines, printers, etc.
	 - Found in not common devices, e.g. aerospace applications, nuclear power plants, etc.
	 - Constraints:
		 - Cost
		 - Application specific performance
		 - Energy efficiency


##### Flynn's Taxonomy
 - Micheal Flynn in 1966 proposed a classification for the exploitation ...
 - Single instruction stream, single data stream (SISD)
	 - Uniprocessor
	 - From the programmer's perspective, it is the standard sequential computer
	 - Can exploit instruction level parallelism (ILP)
	 - Uses ILP techniques such as superscalr and speculative execution
 - Single instruction stream, multiple data streams (SIMD)
	 - Instances of the same instruction are executed by multiple processors
	 - Like a GPU, perform addition on multiple pieces of data
 - Multiple instruction stream, single data streams (MISD)
	 - Perform 2 or more different instructions on the same data simultaneously
	 - The resulting value depends on which instruction finishes last
 - Multiple instruction stream, multiple data streams (MIMD)
	 - Parallelism???


##### RISC vs. CISC
 - RISC = *Reduced* Instruction Set Computer
 - CISC = *Complex* Instruction Set Computer
 - RISC
	 - Reduces the number of CPU cycles per instruction
	 - However, program requires more instructions
	 - Less memory per instruction
 - CISC
	 - Reduces the number of instructions per program
	 - Increases the number of CPU cycles per instruction
	 - More memory per instruction


##### RISC
 - ...
	 - Fewer number of instructions, often in the hundreds
	 - Fixed instruction length - all instructions are the same length, typically one word (32-bits)
 - Single cycle execution
	 - Try to execute every instruction in one CPU cycle
 - Load/Store architecture
 - Large number of registers
	 - Typically have a larger number of general purpose registers, meaning more data can be stored in the CPU
 - Pipelining
	 - RISC is designed for efficient pipelining, i.e. high throughput
 - Simple addressing modes
 - Compiler optimisations
 - ...
 - High instruction throughput
	 - Due to a small and fast instruction set, pipelining, 
 - Simple instruction format
 - Example RISC chips
	 - ARM
	 - PowerPC
	 - etc
