##### Core Characteristics of RISC
**RISC** (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architectures, like RISC-V, are designed for *efficiency* and *high performance*.
Key Features include:
 - **Small Instruction Set**
	 - Contains *fewer* and *simpler instructions* compared to CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architectures.
 - **Single Cycle Execution**
	 - Most instructions complete in one CPU clock cycle.
 - **Load/Store Architecture**
	 - Memory access is restricted to specific load and store instructions; *all other operations are performed directly on registers*.
 - **Uniform Instruction Format**
	 - *Instructions* have a *fixed length*, which makes the *decoding* process *faster* and *simpler* for the hardware.
 - **Large Register Set**
	 - A *high number of general-purpose registers* are available to *minimise* the need for *frequent and slow memory accesses*.
 - **High Instruction Throughput**
	 - Optimised for pipelining, allowing most instructions to complete in a single clock cycle (CPI = 1) under ideal conditions.


##### Pipelined Execution
**Pipelining** is a central concept in modern RISC architectures where *multiple instructions* are executed *simultaneously* by *overlapping* their stages.
Main Advantage
It increases throughput (the total number of operations completed over time) rather than reducing the latency (the time it takes for a single instructions to finish).
