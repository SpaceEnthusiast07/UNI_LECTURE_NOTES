##### What is the Operating System?
![[Pasted image 20260112144934.png]]
 - An ***Operating System (OS)*** is a program that controls the execution of *application programs* and acts as an *interface* between applications and the computer hardware.
 - ***Application Programs*** are programs designed for users to complete certain tasks, such as a web browser for browsing the WWW and a word processor for processing text documents.
 - An *OS* can be thought of as having three *objectives*:
	 - *Convenience* - An OS makes a computer more convenient to use
	 - *Efficiency* - An OS allows the computer's system resources to be used in an efficient manner
	 - *Evolution* - An OS should be constructed in such as wat as to permit the effective development, testing and introduction of new system functions without interfering with service.


##### OS Services
 - These ***services*** are the *core functions* provided by the OS to manage computer hardware and software resources.
 - The OS provides a collection of services:
	 - File management
	 - Input/Output management
	 - Process management
	 - Memory management
	 - Multiprocessor management


##### The Kernel
 - The ***kernel*** is the most central part of an OS
 - The most frequently used functions of the OS are included in the kernel
 - The functionality that is included in the kernel depends on the *OS design*


##### User vs Kernel Mode
![[Pasted image 20260112174141.png]]
 - ***User Mode*** (Unprivileged)
	 - *Purpose*: Runs user applications (browsers, word processers).
	 - *Access*: Limited; cannot directly access hardware, memory or critical system functions.
	 - *Isolation*: Each process has its own isolated memory space, preventing interference.
	 - *Interaction*: Uses *system calls* to request kernel services (e.g. to save a file).
	 - *Safety*: A crash typically only affects that single application.
 - ***Kernel Mode*** (Privileged)
	 - *Purpose*: Runs the core OS (kernel) and device drivers.
	 - *Access*: Full, unrestricted access to all hardware and memory.
	 - *Isolation*: Less isolated; all kernel components share memory.
	 - *Interaction*: Directly manages resources and hardware.
	 - *Safety*: A crash (like a "kernel panic") often brings down the entire system.
 - The System Call
	 - Think of it like a bank
	 - You (User Mode): You are in the lobby, you cannot go behind the counter.
	 - Bank Teller (Kernel Mode): The teller can access all the money and records.
	 - Asking for Money (System Call): You ask the teller (via a controlled interface) to get your money; they verify your identity and perform the action for you.
 - This architecture *protects* the *system's integrity* by mediating all access to powerful resources through the trusted kernel.


##### Mode Switch
 - A Mode Switch is a transition between user mode and kernel mode.
 - Mode switches are computationally expensive.


#### Operating System Structures
##### Monolithic
![[Pasted image 20260112205058.png]]
 - All services provided by the OS are loaded into memory and are contained within a large kernel.
 - "Everything is connected to everything" - All services have a direct line of communication to any other service.
 - *Pros*: Communication within the kernel is very fast, since direct communication is possible
 - *Cons*: Since everything is connected to everything, the OS becomes difficult to understand, difficult to modify and less secure (because it is harder to take into consideration all the possible vulnerabilities).

##### Layered
![[Pasted image 20260112205422.png]]
 - A layered OS organises its services into distinct layers.
 - Each layer can only communicate with the layer above and below it.
 - *Pros*: The OS is easier to debug and development can be organised into separate units since each layer is logically separate from all other layers. Each team only needs to work together on how their layer communicates with the other layer, the rest is up to themselves.
 - *Cons*: Performance can be poor since access to one particular service requires traversing through other services (layers).

##### Microkernel
![[Pasted image 20260112210207.png]]
 - A microkernel OS is a traditional OS, but with some services implemented by *servers*.
 - A *server* is a user-space process that performs a specific job that a traditional kernel service would usually do.
 - E.g. instead of the file system manager being part of the kernel code, it runs as its own program within the user space.
 - *Pros*: The OS is secure and reliable.
 - *Cons*: Performance may be poor due to the increased communication overhead and the computationally expensive *mode switch* that must be done.

##### Modular
 - A modular OS starts off with a very small kernel containing the bear essential services required to run.
 - Then, if required, other services are loaded into memory and once finished with, removed from memory.
 - In the modular structure, the services that are active (loaded in memory) are connected like in the monolithic structure, everything to everything.
 - *Pros*: The OS is fast since unnecessary services are not loaded and each active service is directly connected to all other active services.
 - *Cons*: As the number of active services increases, the structure starts to resemble a monolithic structure, inheriting some of its cons. Also, performance is affected by the overhead of loading and off-loading services when needed or not required any more.
