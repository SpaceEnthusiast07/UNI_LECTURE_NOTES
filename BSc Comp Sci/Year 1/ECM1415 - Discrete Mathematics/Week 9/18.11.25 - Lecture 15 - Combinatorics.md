##### What is Combinatorics?
 - ***Combinators*** is concerned with counting problems
 - Usually these problems involve:
	 - Counting a lot of things
	 - With some restrictions on what to include
 - Examples: ![[Pasted image 20251118134201.png]]
 - Fortunately, there are a lot of tricks and theory that we can use to simplify counting problems


#### The Basics of Counting
##### Direct Enumeration
 - Write out/count every possibility
 - Problems arise when the number of combinations grows really large
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251118134438.png]]
 - You can use trees to simplify the problem: ![[Pasted image 20251118134653.png]]


##### Product Rule
 - ***Product Rule***: If task 1 can be done in $n_{1}$ ways and task 2 can be done in $n_{2}$ ways, and task 1 *does not affect* task 2, then there are $n_{1}$ x $n_{2}$ ways to do tasks 1 and 2. ![[Pasted image 20251118135045.png]]
 - Example - Bit Strings: ![[Pasted image 20251118135216.png]]
 - Example - Racing: ![[Pasted image 20251118135234.png]]
 - Example - Subsets: ![[Pasted image 20251118135429.png]]
 - Example - QR Code: ![[Pasted image 20251118135454.png]] ![[Pasted image 20251118135512.png]]


##### Sum Rule
 - ***Sum Rule***: If a task can be done in $n_{1}$ ways OR $n_{2}$ ways, where all the $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ ways are distinct, then there are $n_{1} + n_{2}$ ways to do it. ![[Pasted image 20251118140029.png]]
 - Example - Passwords: ![[Pasted image 20251118140047.png]]


##### Subtraction Rule - Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
 - Inclusion-Exclusion Principle: ![[Pasted image 20251118140640.png]] ![[Pasted image 20251118140712.png]]


##### Division Rule
 - Division Rule: If a task can be done in $n$ ways, and for every way $w$ there are $d$ equivalent ways to $w$, then there are $\frac{n}{d}$ ways to do the task. ![[Pasted image 20251118140831.png]]
 - Example - Playing Cards: ![[Pasted image 20251118140949.png]]


#### The Pigeonhole Principle
##### Pigeonhole Principle
 - ***Pigeonhole Principle***: If you have more pigeons than holes, some of them will have to share! ![[Pasted image 20251118141201.png]]
 - E.g., if you have 10 pigeons and 8 holes, obviously some pigeons are going to share!
 - Proof of the Pigeonhole Principle: ![[Pasted image 20251118141225.png]]
