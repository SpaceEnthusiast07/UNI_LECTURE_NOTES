##### Recursive Functions
##### Recursively Defined Functions
 - A ***recursive*** or *inductive definition* of a function consists of two steps:
	 - *Basis Step*: Specify the value of the function when the input is zero $(0)$
	 - *Recursive Step*: Give a rule for finding the output of the function for an integer input greater than zero


##### Example: Factorial Function
 - The factorial function $n!$ can be defined as follows:
 - *Basis*: $f(0) = 1$
 - *Recursive*: $f(n+1) = (n+1) * f(n)$


##### Proving Properties of Recursive Functions
 - The Fibonacci numbers can be defined as follows:
	 - $f(0) = 0$ $\leftarrow$ *Basis* step
	 - $f(1) = 1$ $\leftarrow$ *Basis* step
	 - $f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$ $\leftarrow$ *Inductive* step
	 - $f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1)$ $\leftarrow$ Extra term stated
	 - $f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n)$ $\leftarrow$ Extra term stated

#### Recursive Sets
##### Recursively Defined Sets
 - Recursive definitions of sets have two parts:
	 - *Basis step*: Specifies an initial collection of elements
	 - *Recursive step*: Gives the rules for forming new elements in the set from those already known to be in the set


##### Example: Multiples of 3
![[Pasted image 20251114101513.png]]
 - Firstly, $x$ and $y$ would be the same; $3$, then you would add the element; $x + y = 3 + 3 = 6$ to set $S$
 - Then, $x=3$ and $y=6$, meaning $3 + 6 = 9$ is added to the set
 - And so on...


#### Structural Induction
##### Structural Induction Definition
 - To prove a property of the elements of a recursively defined set, we use structural induction, the steps are:
	 - *Basis step*: Show that the result/property holds for elements specified in the basis step of the definition of the recursive set
	 - *Inductive step*: Show that if the property is true for each of the elements used to construct new elements in the recursive step, the result holds for these new elements
