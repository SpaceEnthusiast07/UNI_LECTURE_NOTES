#### Mathematical Induction
##### Principle of Mathematical Induction
 - Allows us to prove $P(n)$ for *all* positive integers $n$

##### Example: Infinite Ladder
 - Suppose we have an infinite ladder
	 1. We can reach the first rung of the ladder
	 2. If we can reach a particular rung, then we can read the next rung
 - We can reach every rung of the ladder
 - *Proof by Induction*
	 - *Basis step*: By $(1)$ we can reach rung $1$
	 - *Inductive step*: Assume that we can reach rung $k$. Then by $(2)$ we can reach rung $k + 1$


##### Using Mathematical Induction
 - *Theorem*: For all positive integers $n$, it holds that $n < 2^n$

##### Example: Postage Stamps
 - Let's prove that every amount of postage of 12 cents or more can be formed using just 4-cent and 5-cent stamps

#### Strong Induction
##### Strong Induction
  - Allows us to prove that $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$

##### Strong Example: Climbing a Ladder
 - Suppose we have an infinite ladder:
	 1. We can reach the first rung of the ladder
	 2. We can reach a particular rung if we can reach all previous rungs
 - We can reach every rung of the ladder
 - *Proof by Induction*
	 - Basis step: By $(1)$ we can reach rung $1$
	 - Inductive step: Assume we can reach all rungs up to rung $k$. Then by $(2)$ we can reach rung $k + 1$


##### Strong Example: Postage Stamps
 - Postage of 12c or more can be formed using just 4c and 5c stamps
