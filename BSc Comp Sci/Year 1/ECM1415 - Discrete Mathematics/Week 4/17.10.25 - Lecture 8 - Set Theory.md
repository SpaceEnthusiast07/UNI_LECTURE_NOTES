##### Basic Operations
 - ***Union***
	 - The *union* of the sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, is the set: $\{x \; | \; x \in A \; \lor \; x \in B\}$
	 - I.e. a set *combining* both sets, removing duplicates
	 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017101103.png]]
 - ***Intersection***
	 - The *intersection* of the sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cap B$, is the set: $\{x \; | \; x \in A \; \land \; x \in B\}$
	 - I.e. a set only containing *elements in both* $A$ and $B$
	 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017101328.png]]
 - ***Difference***
	 - The difference of the sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A - B$, is the set: $\{x \; | \; x \in A \; \land \; x \notin B\}$
	 - I.e. a set containing elements *only from* set $A$, *non from* set $B$
	 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017101834.png]]
 - ***Complement***
	 - The *complement* of the set $A$ (with respect to set $U$), denoted by $\bar A$, is the set: $\bar A = U - A \text{ (the difference of set U and A) } = \{x \; | \; x \in U \; \land \; x \notin A\}$
	 - I.e. a set containing *elements from* set $U$ that are *not in* set $A$
	 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017102350.png]]

##### Proving Set Identities
 - ***Subset Method***
	 - Note that $A = B \; \equiv \; A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A$
	 - In plain English: "Set $A$ is equal to set B $\equiv$ set $A$ is a sub set of $B$ AND set $B$ is a subset of $A$"
	 - Thus, to show that $A = B$ we can simply show $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$ ![[Pasted image 20251020205035.png]]
 - ***Equational Reasoning***
	 - We can use existing identities to derive new ones ![[Pasted image 20251020205330.png]]
 - ***Membership Table***
	 - Similar to Truth Tables in Boolean logic, we can use *membership tables* to prove set equalities ![[Pasted image 20251020205645.png]]
	 - With *membership tables*, 
		 - Intersection $\cap$ is treated as Logical AND $\land$
		 - Union $\cup$ is treated as Logical OR $\lor$
