##### Sets
 - A ***set*** is an unordered collection of objects
 - The objects within a set are known as its *elements* or members
 - A set is said to *contain* its elements
 - The notation $a \in A$ denotes that $a$ *is* an element of set $A$
 - The notation $a \notin A$ denotes that $a$ *is not* an element of set $A$
 - ***Rooster Method*** - a method of defining sets
	 - E.g.: $S=\{a,b,c,d\}$ denotes a set $S$ containing elements $a, b, c, d$
	 - You can use ellipses when the pattern is clear, e.g. $S=\{a,b,c,d,...,z\}$

##### Describing a Set
 - ***Set-Builder Notation*** - used to specify the property or properties that all members should follow
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251014141334.png]]
	 - $|$  - is the divider between the elements and properties
 - You can specify the first and last elements like this: ![[Pasted image 20251014141630.png]]
	 - $[$ - denotes $\leq$
	 - $]$ - denotes $\geq$
	 - $($ - denotes $<$
	 - $)$ - denotes $>$


##### Common Sets
 - $N = \{0,1,2,3,...\}$: set of natural numbers
 - $Z = \{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}$: set of integers
 - $Z^+ = \{1,2,3,...\}$: set of positive integers
