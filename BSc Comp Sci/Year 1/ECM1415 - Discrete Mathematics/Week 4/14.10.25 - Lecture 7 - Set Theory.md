##### Sets
 - A ***set*** is an *unordered* collection of objects
 - The objects within a set are known as its *elements* or members
 - A set is said to *contain* its elements
 - The notation $a \in A$ denotes that $a$ *is* an element of set $A$
 - The notation $a \notin A$ denotes that $a$ *is not* an element of set $A$
 - ***Rooster Method*** - a method of defining sets
	 - E.g.: $S=\{a,b,c,d\}$ denotes a set $S$ containing elements $a, b, c, d$
	 - You can use ellipses when the pattern is clear, e.g. $S=\{a,b,c,d,...,z\}$

##### Describing a Set
 - ***Set-Builder Notation*** - used to specify the property or properties that all members should follow
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251014141334.png]]
	 - $|$  - is the divider between the elements (left) and properties (right)
 - You can specify the first and last elements like this: ![[Pasted image 20251014141630.png]]
	 - $[$ - denotes $\leq$
	 - $]$ - denotes $\geq$
	 - $($ - denotes $<$
	 - $)$ - denotes $>$


##### Common Sets
 - $N = \{0,1,2,3,...\}$: set of natural numbers
 - $Z = \{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}$: set of integers
 - $Z^+ = \{1,2,3,...\}$: set of positive integers
 - $Q = \{\dfrac{p}{q} \; | \; p \in Z, q \in Z, q Â¬= 0\}$: set of rational numbers
 - $R$: set of real numbers
 - $R^+$: set of positive real numbers
 - $C$: set of complex numbers


##### Universal and Empty Set
 - The ***Universal Set*** $U$ is the set containing *everything under consideration*
	 - Sometimes the set is implicitly or explicitly stated
 - The ***Empty Set*** is denoted by $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$ and is the set with *no* elements


##### Cardinality
 - ***Cardinality*** refers to the *number* $n$ of *distinct* elements in a set, denoted by $|A|$
 - If there are exactly $n \in N$ *distinct* elements in $S$, we say $S$ is *finite*
 - A set which is not finite is called *infinite*
 - Examples: ![[Pasted image 20251017094221.png]]


##### Set Equality
 - Two sets $A$ and $B$ are *equal* if and only if they have the *same elements*
$$
A=B \; \leftrightarrow \; \forall x. (x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B)
$$
 - Within the Rooster method, the *order is not important* and *repetitions do not change the set*
 - Examples: ![[Pasted image 20251017095141.png]]


##### Subsets
 - The set $A$ is a *subset* of $B$, denoted by $A \subseteq B$, if and only if *every element* of $A$ is *also an element* of $B$
 - I.e. $A \subseteq B \implies$ $B$ contains $A$ OR $A=B$
 - If $A \subseteq B$, but $A \not= B$, we say $A$ is a *proper subset* of $B$, denoted $A \subset B$
 - Examples: ![[Pasted image 20251017095602.png]]
 - ***Power Set*** - A set containing all the subsets of a set $A$, denoted by $\wp (A)$
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017100058.png]]


##### Proving a Set is a Subset of another Set
 - Steps:
	 - To show that $A \subseteq B$, *assume* $x$ belongs to $A$ and *show that* $x$ also belongs to $B$
	 - To show that $A$ is not a subset of $B$, find an element $x \in A$ where $x \notin B$
