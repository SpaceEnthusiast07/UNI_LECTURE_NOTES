##### Proofs
 - A ***proof*** is a valid argument that *establishes the truth* of a statement
 - ***Formal*** Proofs:
	 - Only one rule of inference is used per step
	 - All steps are stated clearly
	 - Rules of inference used are always explicitly stated
 - ***Informal*** Proofs:
	 - More than one rule of inference is often used in one step
	 - Steps may be skipped
	 - The rules of inference used are not explicitly stated
 - Terminology:
	 - ***Theorem*** - An important statement that can be proven
	 - ***Lemma*** - A result which is needed to prove a theorem
	 - ***Corollary*** - A result which follows directly from a theorem
	 - ***Conjecture*** - A statement what is being proposed to be true, but might not be


##### Proof Techniques
 - When you must prove $S$, where $S = p \rightarrow q$:
 - ***Direct***: assume $p$ and derive $q$ (most common)
 - ***Contrapositive***: prove $Â¬q \rightarrow Â¬p$ -> useful if $Â¬q$ gives usable structure
 - ***Vacuous***: if you can show $p$ is impossible (always false), the $p \rightarrow q$ is automatically true
 - ***Trivial***: if $q$ is a tautology (always true), then $p \rightarrow q$ is true for all $p$
 - ***Proof by Contradiction***: assume $Â¬S$ to be true and derive a statement $A$ and its negation $Â¬A$ and show these are impossible, conclude that $Â¬S$ is impossible, so $S$ must be true
 - Which to pick? Try direct first, if that fails, try contrapositive
 - *Example*: Even and Odd integers
	 - The integer $n$ is even if there exists a integer $k$ such that $n = 2k$
	 - The integer $n$ is odd if there exists a integer $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$
	 - *Theorem 1*: "If $n$ is an odd integer, then $n^2$ is also odd"
	 - *Proof 1* - using *Direct*:
		 - Assume that $n$ is odd
		 - Then, $n = 2k + 1$ for an integer $k$
		 - Thus, $n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1 = 2r + 1$, where $r = 2k^2 + 2k$
		 - Therefore, $n^2$ is odd given that $n$ is an odd integer
	 - *Proof 2* - using *Contrapositive*:
		 - Assume $n$ is even
		 - Then, there exists an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k$
		 - Hence, $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2) = 2r$, where $r = 2k^2$
		 - Therefore, if $n$ is odd, $n^2$ is also odd


##### Proving Biconditionals
 - To prove $p \leftrightarrow q$ is true
 - First prove $p \rightarrow q$ is true
 - Then prove $q \rightarrow p$ is true
 - Often each direction uses a different technique, direct one way and contrapositive the other


##### Proof by Contradiction
 - To prove $p$, assume $Â¬p$ to be true and derive a *contradiction* such as $q \land Â¬q$
 - Since you have shown that $Â¬p \rightarrow F$ is true, it follows that $T \rightarrow p$ is also true![[Pasted image 20251019160533.png]]
 - ... Therefore, if $3n + 2$ is odd, $n$ must be odd


##### Counterexamples
 - To show that a statement of the form $\forall x. P(x)$ is false, we need to find a *counterexample*, an example $x$ for which $P(x)$ is false
 - I.e. if at least one element $x$ from the domain results in $P(x)$ being false, therefore $\forall x. P(x)$ is false, since not every element in the domain makes $P(x)$ true

##### Proof by Cases
 - How to partition: choose mutually exclusive, exhaustive categories, e.g. parity: even/odd or sign: -ve/zero/+ve
 - Prove the claim in each case ![[Pasted image 20251019161414.png]]


##### Exhaustive Proofs
 - Some theorems can be proved by examining a relatively small number of examples: ![[Pasted image 20251019162010.png]]


##### Existence Proofs
 - ***Constructive***:
	 - In a *constructive* proof, we try to find an explicit value of $c$, for which $P(c)$ is true.
	 - Then we conclude that $\exists x. P(x)$ is true by *Existential Generalisation* (EG) ![[Pasted image 20251019162345.png]]
		 - $P(x)$ = a positive integer $x$ can be written as the sum of cubes of positive integers
		 - $c$ = 1729
		 - Since $P(1729)$ = true
		 - Therefore, $\exists x. P(x)$ = true
 - ***Nonconstructive***:
	 - Similar to proof by contradiction
	 - In a *nonconstructive* proof, we assume no $c$ exists which makes $P(c)$ true and derive a contradiction ![[Pasted image 20251019163152.png]]
	 - Cool proof!! ðŸ˜‚
