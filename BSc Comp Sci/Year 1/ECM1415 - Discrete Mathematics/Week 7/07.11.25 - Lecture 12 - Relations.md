#### Equivalences
##### Equivalence Relations
 - A relation on a set $A$ is called an ***equivalence relation*** if it is *reflexive*, *symmetric* and *transitive*
 - Elements $a$ and $b$ related by an equivalence relation are called *equivalent*
 - $a \sim b$ is used to denote that $a$ and $b$ are equivalent
 - Examples: ![[Pasted image 20251109135854.png]]


##### Equivalence Classes
 - Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a set $A$
 - The set of all elements that are related to an element $a$ of $A$ is called the ***equivalence class*** of $a$
 - The equivalence class of $a$ with respect to $R$ is denoted by $[a]_R = \{s \; | \; (a,s) \in R\}$
 - If $b \in [a]_R$, then $b$ is called a *representative* of this equivalence class
 - In other words, an equivalence class collects all elements that are equivalent to each other
 - Example:
	 - If the relation is; "has the same remainder when divided by $3$", then the equivalence class for $4$ would be:
		 - $[4]$ = $\{ ..., 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ... \}$, call elements that have remainder $1$ when divided by $3$

##### Partition of a Set
 - A ***partition*** of a set $S$ is a collection of *disjoint* *nonempty* subsets of $S$ that have $S$ as their union
 - Disjoint = The subsets do not *overlap*
 - Nonempty = Each subset must contain at least one element, no empty sets
 - Union = If you you put all the subsets back together, you should get the original big set, no missing elements
 - Example:
	 - $S = \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$
	 - On possible partition includes;
		 - $A_1 = \{ 1,2 \}$
		 - $A_2 = \{ 3,4 \}$
		 - $A_3 = \{ 5,6 \}$
	 - Each subset is nonempty
	 - They are disjoint (no repeating numbers)
	 - Together they make up all of $S$
 - Link to Equivalences: Each equivalence class in an equivalence relation is a set from the partition of the equivalence relation

#### Partial Orderings
##### Partial Orderings
 - A relation $R$ on a set $S$ is called a ***partial ordering*** if it is *reflexive*, *antisymmetric* and *transitive*
 - A set together with a partial ordering $R$ is called a *partially ordered set*, or *poset*, and I denoted by $(S,R)$
 - Members of set $S$ are called elements of the poset
 - Example of partial ordering: ![[Pasted image 20251109164509.png]]


##### Hasse Diagrams
 - A ***Hasse diagram*** is a visual representation of a partial ordering that leaves out edges that must be present because of the reflexive and transitive properties
