##### Tuples
 - ***N-Tuples*** are *ordered* collections of data
 - Two *n-tuples* are equal iff they both contain the same elements in the same order
 - 2-tuples are called ordered pairs
 - ***Cartesian Product***
	 - The cartesian product of the sets $A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_n$ is denoted by $A_1$ x $A_2$ x $...$ x $A_n$  and is the ordered n-tuples ($a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n$) where $a_i$ belongs to $A_i$ for $i = 1,2,3,...,n$
	 - I.e. $A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_n$ = a n-tuple containing *every combination* of elements from each set

##### Binary Relations
 - A *binary relation* $R$ from set $A$ to a set $B$ is a subset $R \subseteq$ ($A$ x $B$)
 - We use the notation $a$ $R$ $b$ to denote that ($a, b$) $\in$ $R$
 - We use the notation $a$ $\not R$ $b$ to denote that ($a, b$) $\notin$ $R$
 - When ($a, b$) belongs to $R$, $a$ is said to be *related* to $b$ by $R$
 - A *relation on set* $A$ is a relation from $A$ to $A$
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251104140027.png]]
 - This is valid since $\{(0,a),(0,b),(1,a),(2,b)\}$ is a subset ($\subseteq$) of $A$ x $B$


##### Forming New Relations
 - We can use basic set operations to form new relations
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251104140258.png]]
 - $\cup$ = Combine, remove duplicates and sort
 - $\cap$ = Elements that are in both
 - $-$ = Elements in first set that are not in the second set


##### Composite Relations
 - The composition of a relation $R_2 \subseteq$ ($B$ x $C$) with $R_1 \subseteq$ ($A$ x $B$) is a relation $R_2 \circ R_1 \subseteq$ ($A$ x $C$), and is defined as:
$$
\{ (a,b) \; | \; \exists b \in B. (a,b) \in R_1 \land (b,c) \in R_2 \}
$$

##### Powers of Relation
 - The powers $R^n$ of a relation $R$ is given by: $R \circ R \circ ... \circ R$, $n$ times
