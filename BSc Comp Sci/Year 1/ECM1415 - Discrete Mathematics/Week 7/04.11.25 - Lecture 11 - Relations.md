#### Relations
##### Tuples
 - ***N-Tuples*** are *ordered* collections of data
 - Two *n-tuples* are equal iff they both contain the same elements in the same order
 - 2-tuples are ordered pairs, e.g. {(1,2), (3,4)}
 - 3-tuples are ordered triples, e.g. {(2,3,5), (5,6,1)}
 - 4-tuples are ordered quadruples, {(6,7,3,9), (91,32,53,3), (3,2,1,3)}
 - And so on ...
 - Tuples can contain duplicate elements, so (1,2,3,1) is a valid 4-tuple
 - *Key Properties*: a tuple is an *ordered* collection of elements and allows for *repetition* (duplicate elements)


##### Cartesian Product
 - The cartesian product of the sets $A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_n$ is denoted by $A_1$ x $A_2$ x $...$ x $A_n$  and is the ordered n-tuples ($a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n$) where $a_i$ belongs to $A_i$ for $i = 1,2,3,...,n$
 - I.e. $A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_n$ = a n-tuple containing *every combination* of elements from each set
 - *Understanding*:
	 - Let $A = \{0,1,2\}$, $B = \{4,5,8\}$ and $C = \{4,6,7,9\}$
	 - $A$ x $B$ = A set containing all possible pairs of elements from $A$ and $B$
	 - $A$ x $B$ x $C$ = A set containing all possible combinations of three elements from $A$, $B$ and $C$
	 - ... and so on
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251104135001.png]]


##### Binary Relations
 - A *binary relation* $R$ from set $A$ to a set $B$ is a subset $R \subseteq$ ($A$ x $B$)
 - A binary relation is *binary* because it is *between two sets*, $A$ and $B$
 - Concepts extend to higher order relations
 - You can think of a *relation* as a *set of tuples*
 - We use the notation $a R b$ to denote that ($a, b$) $\in$ $R$
 - We use the notation $a \not R b$ to denote that ($a, b$) $\notin$ $R$
 - When ($a, b$) belongs to $R$, $a$ is said to be *related* to $b$ by $R$
 - A *relation on set* $A$ is a relation from $A$ to $A$
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251104140027.png]]
 - This is valid since $\{(0,a),(0,b),(1,a),(2,b)\}$ is a subset ($\subseteq$) of $A$ x $B$


##### Forming New Relations
 - We can use basic set operations to form new relations
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251104140258.png]]
 - $\cup$ = Combine, remove duplicates and sort
 - $\cap$ = Elements that are in both relations/sets
 - $-$ = Elements in first set that are not in the second set


##### Composite Relations
 - The composition of a relation $R_2 \subseteq$ ($B$ x $C$) with $R_1 \subseteq$ ($A$ x $B$) is a relation $R_2 \circ R_1 \subseteq$ ($A$ x $C$), and is defined as:
$$
\{ (a,c) \; | \; \exists b \in B. (a,b) \in R_1 \land (b,c) \in R_2 \}
$$
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251104141929.png]]![[Pasted image 20251104142227.png]]
 - Walk through of second composition example:
	 - $1R1$ and $1S0$, so $1R \circ S0$ 
	 - $1R4$ and $4S1$, so $1R \circ S 1$ 
	 - $2R3$ and $3S1$, so $2R \circ S1$ 
	 - $2R3$ and $3S2$, so $2R \circ S2$ 
	 - $3R1$ and $1S0$, so $3R \circ S0$ 
	 - $3R4$ and $4S1$, so $3R \circ S1$ 


##### Powers of Relation
 - The powers $R^n$ of a relation $R$ is given by: $R \circ R \circ ... \circ R$, $n$ times
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251104142448.png]]![[Pasted image 20251104142500.png]]


#### Properties of Relations
##### Reflexive Relations
 - A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is ***reflexive*** iff $(a,a) \in R$, $\forall a \in A$ 
 - I.e. Every element in $A$ is related to itself $\rightarrow$ $aRa$, $\forall a \in A$
 - Two examples of reflexive relations: ![[Pasted image 20251107173330.png]]
	 - 1 $\rightarrow$ $\forall a \in A$, $a = a$ $\rightarrow$ True
	 - 2 $\rightarrow$ $\forall a \in A$, $a \leq a$ $\rightarrow$ True
 - Two examples of non reflexive relations: ![[Pasted image 20251107173357.png]]
	 - 1 $\rightarrow$ $\forall a \in A$, $a > a$ $\rightarrow$ False, e.g. $a = 7$
	 - 2 $\rightarrow$ $\forall a \in A$, $a + a \leq 3$ $\rightarrow$ False, e.g. $a = 4$


##### Symmetric Relations
 - A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is *symmetric* iff $(b, a) \in R$ whenever $(a, b) \in R$, $\forall ab \in A$
 - In other words, if $aRb$ and $bRa$, $\forall ab \in A$, then the relation $R$ is *symmetric*
$$\forall xy. (((x,y) \in R) \rightarrow ((y,x) \in R))$$
 - Two examples of symmetric relations: ![[Pasted image 20251107174206.png]]
 - Two examples of asymmetric relations: ![[Pasted image 20251107174219.png]]


##### Antisymmetric Relations
 - A relation $R$ on a set $A$ such that $\forall ab \in A$, if $aRb$ and $bRa$, then $a = b$ is called *antisymmetric*
$$\forall ab. ((aRb) \land (bRa) \rightarrow a=b)$$
 - I.e. 
 - Two examples of Antisymmetric relations: ![[Pasted image 20251109124518.png]]
 - Two examples of non Antisymmetric relations: ![[Pasted image 20251109124538.png]]


##### Transitive Relations
 - A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called *transitive* if whenever $aRb$ and $bRc$, then $aRc$, $\forall abc \in A$
$$\forall abc. ((aRb) \land (bRc) \rightarrow (aRc))$$
 - In other words, if $aRb$ and $bRc$ implies $aRc$, then the relation $R$ is transitive
 - Two examples of transitive relations: ![[Pasted image 20251109131858.png]]
 - Two examples of non transitive relations: ![[Pasted image 20251109131909.png]]


##### Closures
 - If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$, then the *closure* of relation $R$ with respect to property $P$, if it exists, is the relation $S$ on set $A$ such that it:
	 - contains relation $R$
	 - satisfies property $P$
	 - is a subset of every subset (power set $\wp$) of $A$ x $A$ containing $R$ with property $P$
 - Example of a reflexive closure: ![[Pasted image 20251109134313.png]]
 - Example of a symmetric closure: ![[Pasted image 20251109134343.png]]
 - Example of a transitive closure: ![[Pasted image 20251109134359.png]]
