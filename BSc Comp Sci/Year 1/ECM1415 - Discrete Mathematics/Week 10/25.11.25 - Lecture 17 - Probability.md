#### Definitions
##### Basic Definitions
 - ***Discrete probability*** $\to$ studies experiments with a finite number of possible outcomes
 - ***Experiment*** $\to$ Some procedure that can be repeated
 - ***Outcome*** $\to$ Results of an experiment
 - ***Sample Space*** $\to$ The set of all outcomes
 - ***Event*** $\to$ A subset of the sample space, a set of *outcomes*
 - Think of an outcome as an *element* of the sample space and an event a *collection of outcomes* (a subset of the sample space)
 - Examples - Sample Space for the following:
	 - Flipping a coin $= \{\text{Head}, \text{Tail}\}$
	 - Rolling a six sided die $= \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
	 - Flipping two coins $= \{(H,H),(H,T),(T,H),(T,T)\}$
	 - Picking a random English word $= \{\text{"All English words!!"}\}$


##### Probability
 - If $S$ is the sample space and all outcomes are equally likely, then the probability of an event $E$  is:
$$p(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|}, \;|E| = \text{Number of elements in set E}$$


##### Frequentist
 - Probabilities represent the expected results of an experiment repeated $n \to \infty$
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251125135654.png]]


##### Subjective
 - Probabilities represent our degree of belief about the outcomes of experiments

	 1. $p(\text{two sixes}) = \frac{1}{36}$
	 2. $p(\text{sum = 7}) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$
	 3. $p(\text{sum} \geq \text{10}) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$
