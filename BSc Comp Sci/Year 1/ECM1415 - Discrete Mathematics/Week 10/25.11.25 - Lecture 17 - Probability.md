#### Definitions
##### Basic Definitions
 - ***Discrete probability*** $\to$ Studies experiments with a finite number of possible outcomes
 - ***Experiment*** $\to$ Some procedure that can be repeated, e.g. flipping a coin
 - ***Outcome*** $\to$ A result of an experiment, e.g. Heads or Tails
 - ***Sample Space*** $\to$ The set of all outcomes
 - ***Event*** $\to$ A subset of the sample space, a set of *outcomes* from a repeated experiment
 - Think of an outcome as an *element* of the sample space and an event a *collection of outcomes* (a subset of the sample space)
 - Examples - What is the *sample space* for the following:
	 - Flipping a coin $= \{\text{Head}, \text{Tail}\}$
	 - Rolling a six sided die $= \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
	 - Flipping two coins $= \{(H,H),(H,T),(T,H),(T,T)\}$
	 - Picking a random English word $= \{\text{"All English words!!"}\}$


##### Probability
 - If $S$ is the *sample space* and all outcomes are *equally likely*, then the probability of an event $E$  is:
$$p(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|}, \;|E| = \text{Number of elements in set E}$$
 - This probability distribution is known as the *uniform distribution* - *all outcomes* have the same probability
 - Example:
	 - $S = \{(H,H),(H,T),(T,H),(T,T)\} \to$ all possible outcomes of flipping two coins
	 - $E = \{(H,T),(T,H)\} \to$ the set of outcomes I am interested in
	 - $p(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5$


##### Frequentist
 - Probabilities represent the expected results of an experiment repeated $n \to \infty$
 - I.e. the more you repeat an experiment, the distribution of outcomes *tends towards* the probability
 - Example - Summarises it nicely: ![[Pasted image 20251125135654.png]]


##### Subjective
 - Probabilities represent our degree of belief about the outcomes of experiments
 - Notes: ![[Pasted image 20251125140342.png]]
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251125140440.png]]
	 1. $p(\text{two sixes}) = \frac{1}{36}$
	 2. $p(\text{sum = 7}) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$
	 3. $p(\text{sum} \geq \text{10}) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$


##### Axioms
 - $0 \leq p(E) \leq 1 \to$ Probabilities are positive numbers between 0 and 1
 - $p(S) = 1 \to$ The probability of the sample space is exhaustive ($1$)
 - If $E_{1}, E_{2}, \dots$ are disjoint events then $p\left( \bigcup_{i=1}^n E_{i} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n p(E_{i}) \to$ For events that have *no members in common (disjoint)*, we get the same probability by combining the sets and then computing the probability as we get from adding the probabilities for each event


##### Probability of the Complement
 - For any event $E$, $\bar{E}$ denotes the complement of $E$ in $S$
$$p(\bar{E}) = 1 - p(E)$$
 - I.e. if $E$ is an event in $S$, then $\bar{E}$ is all other events in $S$
 - Proof: ![[Pasted image 20251128104222.png]]
 - Set diagram showing what this looks like: ![[Pasted image 20251128104300.png]]


##### Probability of the Union
 - $p(A \cup B) = p(A) + p(B) - p(A \cap B)$
 - Diagrammatic representation: ![[Pasted image 20251128104738.png]]


#### Probability Rules
##### Conditional Probability
 - The probability of $A$ given $B$, written as $p(A|B)$ is:
$$p(A|B) = \frac{p(A \cap B)}{p(B)}$$
 - "$|$" denotes "given"
 - The fact that one event happened can change how likely another event is
 - In words:
	 - $p(A|B) \to$ "What is the new probability of $A$ given that $B$ happened"
	 - Given that $B$ has happened, the sample space is restricted from $S$ to $B$
	 - $p(A \cap B) \to$ "The prob. of $A$ in this new sample space of $B$"


##### Independence
 - We say that two events are independent if:
$$p(A|B) = P(A)$$
 - I.e. since $A$ and $B$ are independent, that fact that $B$ has happened doesn't give us any new information about $A$, hence $p(A)$ is unchanged
 - The is equivalent to
$$p(A \cap B) = p(A)*p(B)$$
