#### Random Variables
##### What is a Random Variable
 - A *random variable* is a function from the set of outcomes to the set of real numbers
 - Note that a random variable is *not a variable*, it is *a function*, this is another bad naming convention that we are stuck with!
 - Example 1:
	 - Say we were flipping a coin
	 - The sample space, $S = \{\text{Heads},\text{Tails}\}$
	 - During this experiment, we could assign $0$ to $\text{Heads}$ and $1$ to $\text{Tails}$
	 - The random variable is what allows us to *map outcomes*; $\text{Heads}$ and $\text{Tails}$ to the *real numbers* $0$ and $1$
 - Example 2: ![[Pasted image 20251128111240.png]]![[Pasted image 20251128111307.png]]


##### Probability Distributions
 - The ***probability distribution*** of a random variable $X$ is the set of all possible outcome-probability pairs
 - Example 1:
	 - Again, say we were flipping a coin
	 - The $p(\text{Heads}) = 0.5$
	 - The $p(\text{Tails}) = 0.5$
	 - Since each event ($\text{Heads}$ or $\text{Tails}$) is equally likely, this is known as a *uniform distribution*
	 - Probability Distribution Graph: ![[Pasted image 20251128112019.png]]
 - Example 2:
	 - Say we were rolling a dice
	 - $p(1) = \frac{1}{6}$
	 - $p(1) = \frac{1}{6}$
	 - $\dots$
	 - $p(6) = \frac{1}{6}$
	 - Again, this is an example of a uniform distribution
