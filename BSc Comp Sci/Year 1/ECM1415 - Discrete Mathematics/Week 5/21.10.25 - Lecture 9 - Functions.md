##### Functions
 - A ***function*** $f$ from a *nonempty* set $A$ to a *nonempty* set $B$ is an assignment of each element of $A$ to *exactly one* element of $B$ ![[Pasted image 20251021134145.png]]
 - This diagram is *not* of a *function* since *one* element in $A$ maps to *two* elements in $B$
 - Function Diagram:
	 - *Ovals* = a set
	 - *Dots* = an element in the set
	 - *Arrows* = shows which element in the input set maps to an element in the output set
 - I.e. a *function* $f$ *maps each element* of the input set $A$ to *exactly one* element of the output set $B$
 - Functions operate on a *many-to-one* basis, meaning that one element of $A$ maps to one element of $B$
 - *Note*: *multiple* elements in the input set $A$ can map to the *same* element in the output set $B$, but not the other way around!
 - *Notation*: A function from set $A$ to set $B$ is denoted by: $f : A \rightarrow B$
 - We write $f(a) = b$, if $b$ is the *unique* element of set $B$ assigned by the function $f$ from the element $a$ of set $A$


##### Function Terminology
 - Given a function $f : A \rightarrow B$, such that $f(a) = b$
 - We say that $f$ *maps* $A$ to $B$ or $f$ is the *mapping* from $A$ to $B$
 - $A$ is called the *domain* of $f$
 - $B$ is called the *codomain* of $f$
 - $b$ is called the *image* of $a$ under the mapping of $f$
 - $a$ is called the *preimage* of $b$
 - The *range* of $f$, denoted $f(A)$, is the *set of all images* of points from set $A$ under the mapping of $f$ ![[Pasted image 20251021135727.png]]
 - The output set $B$ can contain elements that are *not mapped* from the input set $A$, therefore the *codomain* is different from the *range*, but not always
 - I.e. the *codomain* can have more elements than the *range*


##### Function Equality
 - Two functions $f$ and $g$ are equal iff they have the same *domain*, *codomain* and map each element of the *domain* to the *same element* of the *codomain*
 - *iff* = if and only if


##### Function Injections
 - A function is said to be ***injective*** (one-to-one) iff $f(a) = f(b)$ which implies $a = b$ for all $a$ and $b$ in the domain of $f$
 - A function can be *injective* even if the *codomain* contains unmapped elements
 - An example of a function that is *not injective*: ![[Pasted image 20251021140526.png]]
 - This is not an injective function since two elements of the *domain* map to one element in the *codomain*, i.e. *not* one-to-one


##### Function Surjections
 - A function $f$ from input set $A$ to output set $B$ is called ***surjective*** or *onto* iff for every element $b \in B$ there is an element $a \in A$ with $f(a) = b$
 - I.e. every element in set $B$ is mapped from an element in set $A$, meaning that the *codomain* and *range* are equal
 - This is an example of a function that is *not surjective* because there is an element in set $B$ that has *no mapping* from set $A$: ![[Pasted image 20251021141506.png]]


##### Function Bijections
 - A function $f$ is a *one-to-one correspondence* (***bijection***), if it is both *injective* and *surjective* ![[Pasted image 20251024094527.png]]
 - This is an example of a *bijective* function because every element in $B$ has a mapping from $A$ (*surjective/onto*) and every element in $A$ maps to one unique element in $B$ (*injective/one-to-one*)
 - I.e. it is a function $f$ such that every element in the codomain has a mapping and it is one-to-one


##### Proving Properties about Functions
 - Suppose that $f : A \rightarrow B$
 - To show that $f$ is *injective* assume $f(x) = f(y)$ and show $x = y$
 - To show that $f$ is *not injective* find $x, y \in A$ such that $x \not = y$ and $f(x) = f(y)$
 - To show that $f$ is *surjective* consider an arbitrary element $y \in B$ and find an element $x \in A$ such that $f(x) = y$
 - To show that $f$ is *not surjective* find $y \in B$ such that $f(x) \not = y$, $\forall x \in A$
 - Proof by Cases for surjectivity:![[Pasted image 20251021144916.png]]


##### Inverse Functions
 - Let $f$ be a bijection from $A$ to $B$
 - Then the ***inverse*** of $f$ is denoted by $f^{-1}$ and is the function from $B$ to $A$ defined as $f^{-1}(y) = x$ iff $f(x) = y$
 - Diagram depicting an inverse function $f$![[Pasted image 20251021145555.png]]
 - Another diagram depicting an inverse function![[Pasted image 20251021145732.png]]
 - Example of an inverse function ![[Pasted image 20251021145843.png]]


##### Composition
 - Let $f : B \rightarrow C$ and $g : A \rightarrow B$
 - The composition of $f$ and $g$, denoted by $f \circ g$, is the function from $A$ to $C$ defined by $f \circ g(x) = f(g(x))$
 - I.e. a function of a function $fg(x) = f(g(x))$, at A-Level
 - ***Identity Function*** is a function that returns the *same* value as the input
 - Therefore, the *composition* of a function and its inverse is an *identity* function
 - Diagram showing function composition: ![[Pasted image 20251021150531.png]]
 - Another diagram depicting a composite function: ![[Pasted image 20251021150752.png]]
 - Example of function composition: ![[Pasted image 20251021150831.png]]


##### Partial Functions
 - A partial function $f$ from the set $A$ to the set $B$ is an assignment to each element $a$ in a subset of $A$, of a unique $b$ in $B$
 - I.e. a function $f$ that doesn't map all of the elements in the input set $A$ (domain) to an element in the output set $B$ (codomain)
 - ***Domain of Definition*** is the *subset* of the input set $A$ for which the function is defined for
 - The function $f$ is *undefined* for elements in $A$ that are *not* in the *domain of definition*
 - When the *domain of definition* of $f$ *equals* the *domain* $A$, $f$ is said to be a ***total function***
 - Example *partial function* where the domain of definition $\not =$ domain: ![[Pasted image 20251024100127.png]]


##### Graphs of Functions
 - The ***graph*** of the function $f : A \rightarrow B$ is the set of ordered pairs:
$$
\{ (a,b) \; | \; a \in A \text{ and } f(a) = b\}
$$
 - I.e. everything in the domain of definition $a$ is plotted on the x-axis and the mapped element in the codomain $b$ is plotted on the
