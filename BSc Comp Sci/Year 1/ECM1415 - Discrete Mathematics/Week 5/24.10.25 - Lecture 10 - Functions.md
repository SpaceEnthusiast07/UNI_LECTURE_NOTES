##### Sequences
 - A ***sequence*** is a function from a *subset* of the integers (as the domain, usually {0, 1, 2, ...} or {1, 2, 3, ...}) to a set $S$
 - The notation $a_n$ is used instead of $a(n)$ to denote the $n^{th}$ element
 - We call $a_n$ a *term* in the sequence
 - Example of a sequence: ![[Pasted image 20251024100903.png]]

##### Geometric Progression
 - A ***geometric progression*** is a sequence of the form: $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ...$
 - Where the *initial term* is $a$ and the *common ratio* $r$ $\in R$ (are real numbers)
 - For a given term $n$, the formula is: $ar^{n-1}$ (starting at term $1$)
	 - When starting at term $0$,  is replaced by $n$
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251024101108.png]]


##### Arithmetic Progression
 - An arithmetic progression is a sequence of the form: $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ...$
 - Where the *initial term* $a$ and the *common difference* $d$ $\in R$ (are real numbers)
 - Are a given term $n$, the formula is: $a + (n-1)d$ (starting at term $1$)
	 - When starting at term $0$, $n-1$ is replaced by $n$
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251024101424.png]]


##### Recurrence Relations
 - A ***recurrence relation*** for the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is an *equation* that expresses $a_n$ in *terms of one or more* of the *previous* terms of the sequence
 - A sequence is called a ***solution*** of a recurrence relation is tis *terms satisfy the recurrence relation*
 - The ***initial conditions*** for a sequence specify the terms that *precede (come before) the first term* where the recurrence relation takes effect.
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251024102533.png]]
 - In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, the *recurrence relation* says that any given term, after the terms stated in the initial condition, is given by the *sum* of the *two previous terms*

##### Solving Recurrence Relations
 - Finding a formula for the $n^{th}$ term of the sequence generated by the recurrence relation is called ***solving the recurrence relation***
 - Since we are trying to find a formula that allows us to calculate a term based on the recurrence relation
