##### Q1 - Coin Flip
When flipping 3 coins, what is the probability of:
1. Three Heads $= p(H,H,H) = \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$
2. Two Heads $= p(H,H,T) + p(H,T,H) + p(T,H,H) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}$
3. At least 2 heads $= p(3 H) + p(2 H) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$


##### Q2 - Urn
An urn contains 5 red balls and 5 blue ones. What is the probability of drawing 2 red balls if balls are drawn
1. with replacement: $\frac{5}{10} * \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{4}$
2. without replacement: $\frac{5}{10} * \frac{4}{9} = \frac{1}{2} * \frac{4}{9} = \frac{2}{9}$


##### Q6 - Dice Distribution
Let $X$ be the random variable which sums the numbers on the top faces after rolling two fair dice. What is the distribution of $X$?

Table of possible values:

|     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |
| 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  |
| 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
Therefore:
$p(X = 2) = \frac{1}{36}$
$p(X = 3) = \frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18}$
$p(X = 4) = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}$
$p(X = 5) = \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9}$
$p(X = 6) = \frac{5}{36}$
$p(X = 7) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$
$p(X = 8) = \frac{5}{36}$
$p(X = 9) = \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9}$
$p(X = 10) = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}$
$p(X = 11) = \frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18}$
$p(X = 12) = \frac{1}{36}$


##### Q7 - Binomial Normalisation
The binomial distribution is
$$p(k; n, p) = C^{n}_{k} \; p^k \; (1 − p)^{n−k}$$
show that this is normalised i.e.
$$\sum^{n}_{k=0} C^{n}_{k} \; p^k \; (1 − p)^{n−k} = 1$$
*Hint: Look at last week’s exercises.*


##### Q8 - Binomial Expectation
What is the expected number of successes in $n$ Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$?
$E[X_{i}] = p$
$X = X_{1} + X_{2} + \dots + X_{n}$
$E[X] = \sum^{n}_{i=1}X_{i} = np$


##### Q9 - Scaling Variance
If the variance of the random variable $X$ is $V [X]$ what is the variance of $aX$ for some constant $a$?
$V[X] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2$
$V[aX] = E[a^2X^2] - E[aX]^2$
$V[aX] = a^2E[X^2] - (aE[X])^2$
$V[aX] = a^2E[X^2] - a^2E[X]^2$
$V[aX] = a^2E[X^2] - (aE[X])^2$
$V[aX] = a^2V[X]$
