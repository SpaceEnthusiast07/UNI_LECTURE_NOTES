#### Basics of Graphs
##### Definitions
 - A ***graph*** is a collection of *vertices * with *edges* connecting them, e.g. ![[Pasted image 20251202133745.png]]
 - A ***vertex*** (*node*) is an object with a label, e.g. the orange points in the above image
 - An ***edge*** is a *link* (*arc*) connecting two nodes together, defining a relationship
 - Graph Structure: ![[Pasted image 20251202134456.png]]
	 - A graph is a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$
	 - Each edge is a tuple that is said to connect two vertices
	 - Two connected vertices are said to be adjacent
 - A ***graph drawing*** is a representation of the *abstract graph* by using some *symbol for the vertices* $V$ and connecting those symbols with *lines for each edge* in $E$
 - The ***degree*** of a vertex, $v$, is denoted $d(v)$, is the *number of edges connected to it*, from the graph drawing above, these are the degrees for each node: ![[Pasted image 20251202135240.png]]
 - The ***degree sequence*** is a collection of numbers representing the *number of vertices with a given degree*, e.g. for the graph above: ![[Pasted image 20251202135423.png]]
	 - $q(1) = 1 \to$ "There is $1$ vertex with the degree $1$"
 - The degree distribution is the probability for any given vertex to have a particular degree e.g. for the graph above: ![[Pasted image 20251202135648.png]]
	 - $q(1) = \frac{1}{8} \to$ "The prob. of a given vertex to have a degree of $1$ is $\frac{1}{8}$"
 - The neighbourhood of a vertex $v$, denoted by $N(v)$, is the set of adjacent vertices, e.g. for the above graph: ![[Pasted image 20251202135940.png]]
	 - Said: "The neighbours of vertex $2$ are vertex $1,3, 4, \text{and} \;5$"
 - Example graphs: ![[Pasted image 20251202140107.png]]![[Pasted image 20251202140122.png]]![[Pasted image 20251202140139.png]]
	 - The third graph has multi-edges between (e.g.) nodes $1$ and $2$ and a self-edge (loop) (e.g.) at vertex $2$


##### Representing Graphs
 - Graph: ![[Pasted image 20251202140439.png]]
 - Vertex and Edge List - useful data structure: ![[Pasted image 20251202140503.png]]
 - Adjacency List - useful in code:![[Pasted image 20251202140542.png]]
 - Adjacency Matrix - useful for maths: ![[Pasted image 20251202140608.png]]
 - Incidence Matrix - used less often: ![[Pasted image 20251202140649.png]]


##### Example Graphs
 - ***Complete Graph*** - a graph where every pair of nodes is connected by an edge, denoted by $K_{n}$ for $n$ nodes. Below is a drawing of $k_{6}$: ![[Pasted image 20251202141109.png]]
 - ***Cycle Graph*** - a graph where the edges are $\{(v_{1},v_{2}), (v_{2},v_{3})\dots(v_{n},v_{1})\}$, denoted by $C_{n}$ for $n$ nodes. Below is a drawing of $C_{6}$: ![[Pasted image 20251202141658.png]]
 - ***Star Graph*** - a graph all $n$ vertices are connect to $1$ central vertex and nothing else, i.e. $E = \{(v_{0},v_{1}),(v_{0},v_{2}),\dots,(v_{0},v_{n})\}$ denoted by $S_{n}$ for $n+1$ vertices. Below is a drawing of $S_{6}$: ![[Pasted image 20251202141845.png]]
 - ***Bipartite Graph*** - a graph where the vertices can be split into two non-overlapping sets where there are no edges between vertices in a set, only between vertices in different sets. Example of a bipartite graph: ![[Screenshot 2025-12-02 145523 - copy.png]]
	 - The two sets are:
		 - $V_{1} = \{1,4,5\}$
		 - $V_{2} = \{2,3,6\}$
	 - If the vertices can be split in this way, we call the vertex sets $V_{1}, V_{2}$ a ***bipartition***
 - ***Special Bipartite*** - If $|V_{1}| = n$ and $|V_{2}| = m$ and there is an edge from every vertex in $V_{1}$ to every vertex in $V_{2}$ then we denote this *special bipartite* graph $K_{n,m}$. Below is an example of a special bipartite: ![[Pasted image 20251202150835.png]]


#### Basic Results
##### The Handshake Lemma/Theorem
 - Also known as the degree sum formula:
$$\sum_{v}d(v) = 2|E|$$
 - In words: the sum of the node degrees is twice the number of edges in a graph
 - Proof: ![[Pasted image 20251202151312.png]]
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251202151445.png]]


##### Isomorphism
 - Two graphs $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ are ***isomorphic*** if there is a *bijective function* $f$ between $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ such that $f(a)$ is incident to $f(b)$ iff $a$ is incident to $b$, If two graphs are isomorphic then $f$ is an *isomorphism*
 - I.e. are you able to manipulate two drawings of a graph so that they are the same, only by translating vertices around and keeping edges the same
 - In general, if two graphs are isomorphic they must have the same:
	 - number of vertices
	 - number of edges
	 - degree sequence
 - Where the degree sequence is the list of degrees $d(v)$ sorted from lowest to highest
 - Note that these are *necessary* but *not sufficient* conditions
