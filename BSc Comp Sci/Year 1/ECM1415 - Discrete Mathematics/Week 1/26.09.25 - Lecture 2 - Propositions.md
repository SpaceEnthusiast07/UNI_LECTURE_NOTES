What is a proposition?
 - A ***proposition*** is a declarative (factual) sentence that is either true or false
 - Examples:
	 - "The moon is made of green cheese" -> false
	 - 1 + 0 = 1 -> true
	 - 0 + 0 = 2 -> false


***Atomic*** Propositions:
 - Variables -> e.g. p, q, r, s
 - Constants -> true, false
 - Examples:
	 - "It is raining."
	 - "The earth is round."
 - They are the basic kind of proposition
 - They cannot be broken down into simpler propositions using logical connectives (i.e. AND, OR, NOT, →, etc...)
 - They are the building blocks for ***compound*** propositions
 - The statement "It is raining ***and*** the sun is out." is not an atomic proposition since it contains the logical connective AND, joining two atomic propositions ("It is raining", "the sun is out").


***Compound*** Propositions:
 - These contain more than one atomic proposition connected using logical connectives
 - Logical Connectives: NOT, AND, OR, Exclusive OR, Implication and Biconditional
 - ***Negation*** (logical not)
	 - denoted by "¬"
	 - Example: if *p* denotes "The earth is round" then *¬p* denotes "The earth is not round"
	 - Truth table:

 - ***Conjunction*** (logical and)
	 - denoted by "ʌ"
	 - Example: if *p* denotes "I am at home" and *q* denotes "It is raining", then *p ʌ q* denotes "I am at home and it is raining"
	 - Truth table: ![[Pasted image 20250926094655.png]]
 - ***Disjunction*** (logical or)
	 - denoted by "∨"
	 - Example: if *p* denotes "I am at home" and *q* denotes "It is raining", then *p ∨ q* denotes "I am at home or it is raining"
	 - Truth table: ![[Pasted image 20250926094749.png]]
 - ***Exclusive Or*** (XOR)
	 - denoted by "⊕"
	 - Example: "Soup or salad comes with this dish, but not both", "Either you walk home now or you wait for the bus, not both"
	 - Truth table: ![[Pasted image 20250926094901.png]]
 - ***Implication***:
	 - denoted by "→"
	 - if *p* and *q* are propositions, then *p → q* is a ***conditional*** statement or ***implication***
	 - *p* is the premise (a proposition from which another can be inferred)
	 - *q* is the conclusion/consequence (the proposition which is inferred from the premise)
	 - Example:
		 - if *p* denotes "The earth is round" and *q* denotes "2 is even", then *p → q* denotes "If the earth is round, then 2 is even"
		 - similarly, *q → p* denotes "if 2 is even, then the earth is round"
		 - if *p* denotes "I am at home" and *q* denotes "It is raining", then *p → q* denotes "If I am at home then it is raining"
	 - Implications are similar to if statements in programming, i.e. if *condition* then *consequence*
	 - Truth table: ![[Pasted image 20250928154455.png]]
	 - Note: *first two rows make sense (similar to if statements), however, last two rows don't*
	 - New conditional statements:
		 - Implication = *p → q*
		 - Converse = *q → p*
		 - Contrapositive = *¬q → ¬p*
		 - Inverse = *¬p → ¬q*
	 - Examples: if *p* denotes "It is raining" and *q* denotes "I am not going to town"
		 - *p → q* = "If it is raining then I am not going to town"
		 - Converse, *q → p* = "If I am not going to town then it is raining"
		 - Contrapositive, *¬q → ¬p* = "If I am going to town then it is not raining"
		 - Inverse, *¬p → ¬q* = "If it is not raining then I am going to town"
	 - Understanding implications (promises):
		 - Think of implications as a promise
		 - *p → q* = "If *p* happens, then *q* will happen", this is the promise (implication)
		 - If *p* happens (true) and *q* fails (false) -> broken promise -> i.e. outcome = False
		 - If *p* happens (true) and *q* succeeds (true) -> promise kept -> i.e. outcome = True
		 - If p doesn't happen (false) -> the promise hasn't been tested, so it cannot be false, its considered ***vacuously true***
 - ***Biconditional***:
	 - denoted by "↔"
	 - If *p* denotes "I am at home" and *q* denotes "It is raining" then *p ↔ q* denotes "I am at home if and only if it is raining"
	 - Standard structure: *p ↔ q* = "*p* if and only if *q*"
	 - Truth table: ![[Pasted image 20250928180943.png]]
	 - Biconditionals are shorthand for writing two implications at once, a two way promise
	 - I.e. *p ↔ q* = *(p → q) ∧ (q → p)*
	 - Promise Analogy:
		 - Perfectly symmetric promise
		 - "I will keep my promise only if you keep yours"
		 - If both keep (true) their promises, fine = true
		 - If they both break (false) their promise, they are equally as bad, so true
		 - If one breaks (false) their promise and the other doesn't (true) then false, as one has ended up worse than the other
 - Terminology:
	 - *Tautology* is a proposition which is always true, e.g. *p ∨ ¬p*
	 - *Contradiction* is a proposition which is always false, e.g. *p ∧ ¬p*
	 - *Contingency* is a proposition which is neither a tautology nor a contradiction, e.g. *p*
 - Precedence:
	 - *Done first --------------------------------------------------> done last*
	 - Negation > Conjunction > Disjunction > Exclusive Or > Implications > Biconditional
	 - E.g. *(p ∨ q) → (¬r)* is equivalent to *p ∨ q → ¬r*
