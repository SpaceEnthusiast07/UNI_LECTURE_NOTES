##### Tuples
 - An ordered sequence of elements
 - 0 based index
 - Immutable - I.e. the contents cannot change once they are instantiated
 - They are the constants of lists
 - Python contains the Tuple data structure but Java does not


##### Tuples in Python
```python
# Creating my immutable tuple
myTuple = (182, 1837, 19, 9, 273, 653, 28)

# Creating my mutable list
myList = [8382, 6372, 8716, 28, 2]
```


##### Return Values
 - Since functions can only return one value, to return multiple values, you can use a Tuple
 - Using a Tuple instead of a List ensures you don't accidentally change any of the values


##### Dictionaries
 - A data structure that stores related data in *Key-Value* pairs
 - ***Key***: A unique item used to identify a value
 - ***Value***: The second item in the pair
 - Real World Example: Similar to a real dictionary, the *Key* is the *word* and the *Value* is the *definition* for that word
 - Both Java and Python contain the dictionary data structure
 - Dictionaries are *like* lists where you can *customise* the name of the *index* for each element
	 - I.e. *Key* is like that index for each value (unique)
	 - *Value* is just the data element
 - Dictionaries are *mutable* - i.e. they can change
 - Dictionaries are useful any time data is related in pairs


##### Dictionaries in Python
 - Dictionary structure: `<DictIdentifier> = {<Key1>:<Value1>, <Key2>:<Value2>, ...}`
 - Accessing a value: `myDict[<key>]`
 - Adding or changing a value: `myDict[<key>] = <value>`
 - If you try to access a key that doesn't exist, you will get a *KeyError*
 - You can check if a key exists in a dictionary using the `in` keyword
 - To check if a value is present use `in` with `.values()`
```python
# Create my dictionary
myDict = {"Hello":872, "World":902}

# Accessing the value of key "Hello"
print(myDict["Hello"])

# Adding a value to the dictionary
myDict["!"] = 392

# Output the value associated with "!" key
print(myDict["!"])

# Checking if "Planet" is a key in the dictionary
print("Planet" in myDict)

# Checking if 872 is a value in the dictionary
print(872 in myDict.values())

--OUTPUT-------------------------------------------------------------
872
392
False
True
```


##### Error Handling
 - Error handling blocks are used if the possibly error are unknown
 - The `try` block lets you run a block of code without worry of it crashing the entire program
 - The `except` block lets you handle any errors that arise within the `try` block
 - The `finally` block lets you execute code regardless of the result of the `try` and `except` blocks
