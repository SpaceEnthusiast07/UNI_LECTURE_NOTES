##### 1. Flowchart and Pseudocode
###### 1.1 Creating a representation of the plane
 - Here is the .html file of the flowchart for the function `create_plane` for the first part of this question, creating the function to initialise a 2d list of the plane's seats:

>[!warning] The draw.io file is in the same directory as this note, but obsidian cannot recognise it, luckily it still uploads to GitHub!

 - Here is the pseudocode for the function `print_plane` that prints a representation of the plane to the command line:
```pseudocode
########################################################
## Print a representation of the plane to the console ##
########################################################

# Create the plane
plane <- create_plane()
```
