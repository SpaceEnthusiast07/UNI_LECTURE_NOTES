#### NumPy
##### What is NumPy
 - Standards for ***Numerical Python***
 - a fast, efficient library for scientific and mathematical computing
 - Lets you work with large arrays and matrices and perform math operations without writing loops


##### Why It's Useful
 1. ***Efficient Data Handling*** - Uses less memory and runs faster that regular Python
 2. ***Vectorised Operations*** - You can perform maths on entire arrays at once (no need for loops)
 3. ***Extensive Functions*** - Has built-in tools for maths, logic, shape manipulation and more


##### Data Types and Structures
 - Supports integers, floats, booleans and complex numbers
 - Core Structure: N-dimensional array (`ndarray`)
 - Arrays can be reshaped, resized and sliced easily


##### Creating and Manipulating Arrays
 - ***Creating***:
	 - `np.array()` $\rightarrow$ converts a python list to array
	 - `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()` $\rightarrow$ arrays fill of zeros or ones respectively
 - ***Manipulating***:
	 - reshape, concatenate or resize arrays
 - ***Indexing***:
	 - Access parts of arrays using indices, slices or conditions (boolean or fancy indexing)


##### Mathematical Operations
 - *Element-wise*: add, subtract, multiply, divide arrays directly
 - *Array-level*: calculate sum, mean, standard deviation, etc
 - *Linear Algebra*: do matrix multiplication, find eigenvalues


##### Useful Built-in Functions
 - *Searching*: `np.where()`, `np.argmax()`
 - *Sorting*: `np.sort()`, `np.argsort()`
 - *Math*: `np.sin()`, `np.log()`, `np.exp()`
 - *Stats*: `np.mean()`, `np.std()`, `np.corrcoef()`


##### Broadcasting and Vectorisation
 - ***Broadcasting***: lets you operate on arrays of different shapes automatically
 - ***Vectorisation***: replaces slow loops with fast, optimised array operations
 - Both improve speed and readability of your code
