What is programming?

·       The act of converting an algorithm into executable code

What is an algorithm?

·       An unambiguous set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem

·       Independent of any programming language

·       Algorithms always have a start and end

·       Written in plain English

What is a flowchart?

·       A visual representation of an algorithm

·       Contains a start and end

·       Oval – Execution instruction, start or end

·       Rectangle – Actions

·       Diamond – Decision/condition

·       Arrow – Flow direction of algorithm

·       Cycles – The possibility of restarting the entire algorithm (or part of it) after a condition is met or not

What is Pseudocode?

·       It is a programming language without a predefined syntax (way of structuring instructions)

·       Contains keywords like regular programming languages

·       Uses indentation to clearly define sections of code, e.g. the code contained within a while loop with be indented

Functions

·       Blocks of self-contained, reusable code that can be called upon within a program

·       Data can be passed in to be used by the function
