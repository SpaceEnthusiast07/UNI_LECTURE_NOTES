##### What is Matplotlib?
 - ***Matplotlib*** is a python library that lets you create visualisations such as; line and scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and contour and 3d plots.
 - It is extremely customisable and works well with other libraries like *NumPy* and *Pandas*
 - Why its useful:
	 - Helps you see patterns in data
	 - Makes results easier to understand
	 - Lets you build clear, professional-looking graphs


##### Core building Blocks
 - Matplotlib has 3 main components:
 - ***Figure***
	 - Think of it as the whole canvas or page
	 - It can contain multiple *plots*
 - ***Axes***
	 - This is the *actual plot area* inside the figure
	 - The $x$-axis and $y$-axis live here
 - ***Plot***
	 - The graphical representation - like a line, dots, bars, etc.
 - Analogy:
	 - *Figure* = sheet of paper
	 - *Axes* = one rectangle on the paper where a chart goes
	 - *Plot* = the line/scatter/bar chart itself


##### Basic Plots
 - Line Plot
	 - Shoes how something changes over time or across ordered data
	 - Good for: trends, progression, time series
 - Scatter Plot
	 - Show individual data points
	 - Good for: relationships between two variables (e.g. height vs weight)
 - Bar Chart
	 - Uses bars to compare categories
	 - Good for: counts, comparisons, categorical data (e.g. sales per month)


##### Customising Plots
 - Matplotlib ales you customise almost everything
 - Colours
	 - You can choose built-in colours like "r", "blue", "green"
	 - Or RGB/Hex values: "156,34,123", "#ff0000"
 - Annotations
	 - Add text or arrows pointing to interesting parts of your plot
	 - E.g. `plt.annotate("Peak", xy=(5,10), xytext=(6,12), arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->"))
 - Grid and Axis Styling - you can modify:
	 - tick marks
	 - axis labels
	 - grid lines
	 - legends


##### Multiple Figures and Subplots
 - Multiple Figures
	 - You can open separate windows or separate plots
 - Subplots
	 - Put many plots in one figure, arranged like a grid
	 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251117154832.png]]
	 - Creates a 2x2 grid of plots
 - Coordinated Layouts
	 - You can adjust spacing, alignment, size, etc.
	 - Advanced tools:
		 - `tight_layout()` - fixes spacing issues
		 - `gridspec` - for complex layouts


##### Advanced Plot Types
 - Histograms
	 - Show the distribution of data
	 - Useful for seeing frequency of values (e.g. exam score distribution)
 - Heatmaps
	 - A grid of colours
	 - Useful for correlations, similarity matrices, 2d data relationships
 - Contour Plots
	 - Show lines of equal value (like elevation lines on maps)
	 - Useful for visualising 3d functions in 2d
 - 3D Plots
	 - Matplotlib has a `3d` toolkit for:
		 - 3D scatter
		 - 3D surface plots
		 - 3D wireframes
	 - You need: `from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D`


##### Best Practices
 - Choose the right type of graph
	 - Line plots for trends
	 - Scatter plot for relationships
	 - Bar chart for category comparison
	 - Histogram for distribution
 - Make it readable
	 - Clear axis labels
	 - Title
	 - Legends
	 - Enough contrast (not too many colours)
 - Handle missing data - use:
	 - interpolation
	 - removing NaNs
	 - marking missing values
	 - pandas `.dropna()` or `.fillna()`
 - Troubleshooting Tips
	 - Check the official docs
	 - Read error messages
	 - try simpler examples to isolate issues
	 - Search typical problems (e.g. "figure too small", "labels cut off")


##### Advanced Terms Explained
 - Figure - The entire blank "page" where you draw plots
 - Axes - The area inside the figure that contains your actual graph
 - Ticks - The little marks on the axes showing the scale
 - Annotations - Text or arrows added on top of the plot to point things out
 - GridSpec - A tool that gives you more control over subplot layouts
 - Distribution - Shows how frequently values occur (using in histograms)
 - Contour Lines - Lines that join points of equal value (like map elevation lines)
 - Correlation - How strongly two variables change together
 - 2D/3D Visualisation - Plotting 2d or 3d data visually
