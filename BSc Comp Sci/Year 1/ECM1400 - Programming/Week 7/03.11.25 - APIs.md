##### Application Programming Interface (API)
 - An ***API*** is a set of *rules* and *protocols* that allow *different* software programs to *communicate* with each other
 - It acts as an *intermediary*, enabling one application to *request* services or data from another and receive a *response* in a standardised way, without needing to know the other program's *internal details*.
 - *Client* = Generates a request
 - *Server* = Generates a response
 - API structure; *Request*-*Response* Model
 - Request: What the client sends, includes;
	 - Method - GET, POST, etc
	 - Headers - Metadata, such as authentication
	 - Body - Data of request
 - Response: What the server returns, includes;
	 - Status Code - Result of request, e.g. 200=OK, 404=Not Found, etc
	 - Body - Response data, often in JSON format
 - Not all APIs are web-based, some may be local and are accessed via code libraries


##### Web APIs
 - The two most common API data formats; XML and JSON
 - XML - Extensible Markup Language
	 - Hierarchical, tag-based structure
	 - XML is self-descriptive but verbose, which makes it slower for web use
	 - Tags are user defined
 - JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
	 - JSON has replaced XML for the data format used by APIs
	 - Lightweight and human-readable
	 - Directly maps to Python dictionaries and JavaScript objects
	 - Data represented as key-value pairs


##### Parsing Data
 - Analysing raw test into logical components
 - Parsing involves converting raw text into a structured, useable format
