##### Intellectual Property
 - The intangible creative work, not the particular physical form
 - This legislation covers any product of human intellect that has commercial value
 - Some legislation under IP includes; copyright, patent, trademark and trade secrets


##### Copyright $\textcopyright$
 - Gives the owner of the copyright the right to control how their creative work is used
 - It applies to the result of an idea or concept rather than the concept itself
 - Example: copyright applies to the Harry Potter books but not to the idea of "a story of a young wizard"
 - ***Automatic*** - copyright is automatically applied to a piece work, you do not need to apply or pay a fee
 - Exceptions, copyrighted work may be used without permission for the following reasons:
	 - Non-commercial research and private study
	 - Criticism, review and reporting current events
	 - Teaching
	 - Helping disabled people
	 - Parody, caricature and pastiche
 - Copyrighted work belongs to the original author unless the work was made during employment or for the employer, consult the contract of employment


##### AI and IP Breaches
 - Example: New York Times accused OpenAI and Microsoft of using millions of its copyrights articles to train its LLMs. Alleged unauthorised scraping of NYT content via web crawlers. AI outputs allegedly reproduced or paraphrased NYT articles, competing with its subscription model
 - Implications: ruling could mandate licensing for training data, impacting costs and innovation


##### AI Generated Content
 - Who owns AI generated content?
 - Well, this is determined case by case
 - Meaning that the developers of the AI model or users could own it. Issues arise when the AI model was trained on copyrighted material with no permission


##### Copyleft $\textcopyleft$
 - A legal licensing method that allows works to be freely used, modified and distributed, with the requirement that derived works must also be shared under the same or similar terms.


##### Trademark

 - Conditions: A trademark cannot be
	 - offensive
	 - descriptive
	 - misleading
	 - three dimensional
	 - non-distinctive (i.e. it must be distinctive)
	 - already used
 - ***Cybersquatting*** - "the practice of registering the name of a well-known company, brand, or person as an internet domain in the hope of later selling it at a profit"


##### Patents
 - "a government authority or licence conferring a right or title for a set period, especially the sole right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention"
 - A patent must be new, involve inventing and capable of industrial applications
 - ***Patent Trolls*** - "a term for a person or company that buys patents *not to create products*, but to *sue other companies* for infringement and demand licensing fees"


##### Trade Secrets
