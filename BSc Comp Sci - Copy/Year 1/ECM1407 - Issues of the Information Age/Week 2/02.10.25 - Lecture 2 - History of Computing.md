##### Mechanical Computers
Charles Babbage
 - 1822: he announces the difference engine
 - 1823: He receives funding from the British Government, he received Â£1700. He then hires an exceptional toolmaker named Joseph Clement
 - 1832: They then built a working prototype
 - 1834: The construction is halted

The Difference Engine
 - It is a calculator that can perform calculations on multiple variable
 - It had storage

The Analytical Engine
 - In 1837 he described a general purpose programmable computer
 - You can input, output and store data
 - It had what was called the Mill, the equivalent of the CPU today

The Difference Engine 2
 - Babbage develops the second version of the difference engine from 1847 through to 1849

Ada Lovelace
 - Babbage met Ada in June 1833
 - Ada is considered the first computer programmer

Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz
 - Proposed the binary number system in 1703
 - He described how to add, subtract, multiply and divide binary numbers
