##### Research
 - What started the AI race/spike?
	 - [Google Trends for "ai" and "chatgpt"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=ai,chatgpt&hl=en) ![[Pasted image 20251011183408.png]]![[Pasted image 20251011183141.png]]
	 - [Reference Link](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-happened-2012-marked-historical-breakthrough-ai-stavros-pavlidis-tc2oe): The first spike in searches for the term "ai" was in January 2012. This is when the deep neural network ***AlexNet*** won the *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)*. This was the first example of a deep neural network, consisting of 8 layers. 
	 - [Reference Link](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/): The current increase in searches started in November 2022. This coincides with the release of OpenAI ChatGPT on the 30th November 2022. This release allowed people to query ChatGPT free of charge and realise how useful it is. The ease of access made ChatGPT explode in popularity and made everyone aware of AI. Since then, OpenAI, and many other companies, have improved their models and provided a free usage plan.
 - What type of AI do we currently have?
	 - [Reference Link](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence-types) and [Another](https://lumenalta.com/insights/what-are-the-different-types-of-ai): The most common type of AI that exists today is *Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)*. Narrow AI is designed to perform a *single* or *small set* of tasks. These systems are *highly specialised* and excel in their assigned tasks. These systems are able to carryout routine tasks, analyse data and make predictions within a specific context. OpenAI ChatGPT is considered a form of Narrow AI as it can only perform text-based chat. Some examples of Narrow AI include; voice assistants, facial recognition systems, autonomous vehicles, etc.
 - What are the future versions of AI?
	 - [Reference Link](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence): ***Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)*** - refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that possesses the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. AGI systems contain certain key traits; Generalisation - allowing it to transfer knowledge and skills learnt in one domain to another, enabling it to adapt to new situations effectively, and Common Sense - since AGI systems will have access to a vast repository of knowledge, they will be able to reason and make decisions based on this common understanding. 
		 - ***OLD*** [Reference Link](https://lumenalta.com/insights/what-are-the-different-types-of-ai): ***Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)*** - refers to systems that have *similar cognitive abilities* to humans. AGI systems possess the means to *transfer knowledge* across various domains, *matching human* reasoning, learning and problem-solving abilities. AGI is still theoretical but, [according to AIMultiple](https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/#expert-survey-on-progress-ai-in-2023), who analysed 10 surveys involving more than 5200 researchers, said that AI researchers predict we will see a complete AGI system between 2040 and 2061. Furthermore, many AI researchers also state that simply scaling up existing architectures will not result in AGI.
	 - [Reference Link](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence-types): ***Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)*** - is the *most advanced* form of AI. It will be able to think, reason, learn, make judgements and possess cognitive abilities that *surpass those of human beings*. These systems will have evolved beyond understanding human sentiments and emotions, along with having *beliefs and desires of their own*.
 - *ADVANCE*: What will the future versions of AI allow use to achieve?
	 - [Reference Link](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence): One key benefit is its ability to solve complex problems currently beyond human capabilities, potentially revolutionizing fields like healthcare and climate change mitigation. Additionally, AGI could significantly enhance productivity and efficiency in various industries through automation and optimization. This increased productivity could free up human time for more creative and fulfilling tasks. 
	 - In the realm of healthcare, AGI holds the potential to revolutionize diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug discovery, ultimately improving overall health outcomes. Similarly, personalized learning experiences tailored by AGI systems could make education more accessible and effective.
	 - Furthermore, AGI-controlled systems could enhance safety in areas like transportation through self-driving vehicles, reducing accidents and increasing overall well-being. The convenience factor is also significant, with AGI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots providing round-the-clock support and assistance.
	 - Lastly, AGI could foster unprecedented levels of innovation and creativity, leading to technological advancements and societal progress.
 - *ADVANCE*: What is the timeline for these new forms of AI?
	 - AGI is still theoretical but, [according to AIMultiple](https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/#expert-survey-on-progress-ai-in-2023), who analysed 10 surveys involving more than 5200 researchers, said that AI researchers predict we will see a complete AGI system between 2040 and 2061. Furthermore, many AI researchers also state that simply scaling up existing architectures will not result in AGI.
 - *INFLUENCE*: What will happen to human creativity and problem solving?
	 - As mentioned earlier, AGI can have the ability to harbour unprecedented levels of innovation and creativity. However, this raises significant questions about the longevity of the originality of human creativity. This enormous strength could see humans not being able to innovate and be creative in ways previously seen, opening up the path for human decline.
	 - As we have seen with the emergence of ChatGPT in November of 2022, more people are resorting to the use of AI to complete a task or assignment in school. This is in contrast to using AI tools to help improve their own work.
	 - This reliance on AI to complete tasks instead of helping, stops people learning and further improving themselves, resulting in worldwide decline in intelligence.
	 - To avoid this, humans could actively think about and use AGI/ANI as tools to enhance/extend the abilities of humans, but not to replace any part of us.
 - Could we see another AI winter?
	 - AI winters mark periods of time where there is a significant decline in funding, computational progress and interest to further improve AI systems.
	 - [Reference Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulocarvao/2025/08/24/are-we-heading-into-another-ai-winter/): To date we have had two major AI winters; approximately mid-1970s to 1980 and late-1980s to mid-1990s.
	 - [Reference Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulocarvao/2025/08/24/are-we-heading-into-another-ai-winter/): The term AI winter was first used in 1984 during a debate at the annual meeting of the *American Association of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)*, where researchers *Roger Schank* and *Marvin Minsky*, veterans of the 1970 winter, warned the the wave of enthusiasm was unsustainable. They were correct and within a few years the billion-dollar AI industry began to unravel, the second AI winter.
	 - [Reference Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulocarvao/2025/08/24/are-we-heading-into-another-ai-winter/): Earlier AI winters were triggered by a common pattern: heavy reliance on government funding, overhyped promises, and brittle technologies that broke down under real-world demands. Today’s environment looks different.
	 - [Reference Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulocarvao/2025/08/24/are-we-heading-into-another-ai-winter/): AI no longer relies on a handful of government agencies. Public funding still matters, but a well-developed venture capital ecosystem now drives much of the investment, spreading the risk across startups and private labs. This diversification makes a sudden collapse less likely.
	 - Furthermore, people understand more the capabilities of current AI systems and appreciate the time it take to research and develop new and improved systems. This results in enthusiasm remaining constant and making an AI collapse less likely.
 - *ADVANCE*: How will quantum computers affect AI?
	 - [Reference Link](https://remotebase.com/blog/can-quantum-computing-accelerate-the-development-of-agi): Experts predict that by combining quantum computing with advanced AI techniques, we might witness breakthroughs in AGI capabilities within the next decade. Quantum-enhanced machine learning could usher in a new era of cognitive architectures, driving innovations in real-world applications. Recent forecasts suggest that the integration of these technologies could lead to significant advancements in areas such as autonomous systems and personalized AI.

##### Script V3
*Script V2 still took me 5:47 to talk about!!*
 - Section Slide
	 - AI's Future Impact
 - Slide 1
	 - What started the explosion in AI interest?
	 - Well, the current increase started in November of 2022.
	 - The sudden surge coincided perfectly with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT on the 30th of November that year.
	 - The release allowed people to query ChatGPT free of charge and realise its immense potential.
	 - The ease of access allowed ChatGPT to explode in popularity and got AI global attention.
 - Slide 2
	 - So, what type of AI do we currently use?
	 - Well, the only type of AI that exists today is known as Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI).
	 - Narrow AI is designed to perform a single or small set of tasks.
	 - ANI is highly specialised and excels in its assigned task.
	 - However, it cannot operate outside its programmed domain, such as image recognition or text-based chat.
 - Slide 3
	 - What does the future hold for us in terms of AI?
	 - The next major step in AI is known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
	 - General AI refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine with the ability to understand and learn any intellectual task that a human being can.
	 - Two notable traits of AGI include generalisation (the ability to transfer knowledge and skills learnt in one domain to another, enabling it to adapt to new situations effectively) and common sense (where AGI can reason and make decisions based on a vast database of common knowledge).
 - Slide 4
	 - How will General AI impact society?
	 - *1. Solve complex problems* - AGI could help tackle some of the world’s most pressing challenges, such as climate change. By analysing vast amounts of data and simulating different scenarios, AGI could identify the most effective strategies for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the effects of global warming.$^{[16]}$ 
	 - *2. Robotics* - AGI could enable robots to perform complex tasks with human-like precision and adaptability. From manufacturing to space exploration, AGI-driven robots could operate in environments that are too dangerous or challenging for humans.$^{[16]}$ 
	 - *3. Healthcare* - Imagine a world where AGI-powered systems diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors, predict pandemics, and even develop personalized treatment plans. AGI could revolutionize healthcare by improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.$^{[16]}$ 
	 - *4. Automation* - AGI could oversee entire processes, making decisions and optimizing workflows in real-time. This could lead to unprecedented efficiency and productivity across industries.$^{[16]}$ 
 - Slide 5 - *Removed slide*
	 - How long will we have to wait until AGI?
	 - General AI is still theoretical but, according to AIMultiple, who analysed 10 surveys involving more than 5200 AI researchers, said that they predict the singularity (which is the point in time when we achieve AGI) between 2040 and 2061.
	 - Furthermore, many AI researchers add that simply scaling up existing architectures will not result in AGI, there needs to be a collaboration between computer scientists, neuro-scientists and quantum scientists.
	 - After the release of ChatGPT and the surge in LLM research, the predicted date has been brought significantly closer.
 - Slide 6
	 - What will happen to human creativity and problem solving?
	 - AGI can have the ability to harbour unprecedented levels of innovation and creativity.
	 - However, this raises significant questions around whether AGI could remove the ability for humans to be creative.
	 - As we have seen with the emergence of ChatGPT, more people are resorting to the use of Narrow AI to complete a task or generate ideas. If this much reliance on ANI has already taken place, imagine the reliance created when people have unrestricted access to General AI.
 - Slide 7
	 - Furthermore, this reliance stops people learning and further improving themselves, resulting in worldwide decline in intelligence.
	 - To avoid this decline, we could adapt our perspective on AI and use this tool to enhance and extend the abilities of humans, allowing us to further the field in all domains. The possibilities are endless!
	 - If no one is willing to adapt, we could see ourselves living the dystopian life depicted in WALL-E, then there is no hope for humanity.
