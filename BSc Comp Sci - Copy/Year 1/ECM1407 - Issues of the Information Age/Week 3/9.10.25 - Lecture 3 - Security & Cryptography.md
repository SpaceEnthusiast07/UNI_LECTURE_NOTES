## 1st Half of Lecture - Security

##### Network Security
 - ***Confidentiality*** - only the sender and receiver should be able to understand the contents of a message. Sender encrypts the message and receiver decrypts.
 - ***Authentication*** - sender and receiver need to know they are communication with each other, not a third party.
 - ***Message Integrity*** - the receiver wants to know that the message sent is the original and the meaning hasn't been modified along the way
 - ***Availability*** - authorised users should only be able to access services available


##### Trade Offs
 - The goal isn't usually to make a system as secure as possible, it is usually within some constraints
 - Some constraints include; cost, usability, convenience, etc
 - In some cases, it is more cost-effective to ensure you are not the easiest target for the attacker, not the most secure
 - Some consideration include; 
	 - Cost of damages vs defending against the attack
	 - Likelihood of the attack
	 - Cost of initiating the attack vs the value gained from this attack


##### More security isn't best
 - The integrity of the system is only as good as the weakest link in the system. 
 - Example:

##### Security Threats
 - ***Interruption*** - disrupt the communication process/channel on a network
	 - This attack is against the ***availability*** of the network
	 - Often called ***Denial of Service (DoS)*** attack, making a resource unavailable to the intended users
 - ***Interception*** - be the middle man in a private communication, get access to the conversation
	 - The attacker gets access to confidential information by snooping the network traffic
	 - These attacks relate to the property of ***confidentiality***
 - ***Modification*** - modify with information or network resources
	 - This is the next level up from ***Interception***
	 - The attacker gains access to confidential information and has the ability to modify this information or network services
	 - This is sometimes known as "*man in the middle*" attack
	 - This relates to the ***Integrity*** of the network
 - ***Fabrication*** - counterfeit software or hardware devices are inserted into the network
	 - Also called "*masquerading*"


##### Firewalls
 - Monitor incoming and outgoing traffic
 - Aim is to prevent malicious data packets from leaving or entering the network
 - The first layer of defence a network has
 - Isolates the inner network from the internet




## 2nd Half of Lecture - Cryptography

##### Encryption
 - The process of turning *plain* text into *cipher* text, resulting in any third parties not being able to *understand* the data, but they can still *read* this data


##### Cryptography
 - The study of mathematical techniques to secure digital information and systems
 - Anyone can read an encrypted message, but not everyone can *understand* the message
 - ***Plain Text*** - The standalone text that can be understood by anyone, e.g. "Hello World"
 - ***Cypher Text*** - The encrypted text, can only be understood by the sender and intended receiver, e.g. "Isjja Hwoas"


##### Caesar Cipher
 - This is the simplest form of encryption
 - It involves shifting the alphabet along and encrypting to respective characters ![[Pasted image 20251009113952.png]]
 - Form the picture above, the key is *-3*, the alphabet is shifted 3 spaces backward
 - Therefore, E would become B, F $\rightarrow$ C, and so on


##### Kerckhoffsâ€™ Principle
 - His principle states that "the encryption algorithm should be able to fall into the hands of the enemy without inconvenience"
 - In summary, just having the algorithm to encrypt shouldn't allow you to decrypt the data


##### Sufficient Key-space Principle
 - Any secure encryption technique should have a sky space that is sufficiently large to render an exhaustive-search (brute force attack, try every combi) infeasible (not worth it)


##### Mono-Alphabetic Substitution Cipher
 - This is where the alphabet is shuffled and each character in the plain text is mapped to the respective character
 - An example of a shuffled alphabet: ![[Pasted image 20251009115522.png]]


##### Symmetric vs Asymmetric
 - ***Symmetric*** - *one* key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data
	 - Issues arise when trying to give the intended receiver the key
	 - If attacker gets hold of this key, game over, messages are no longer secure
 - ***Asymmetric*** - a *public*-key is used to encrypt and a *private*-key is used to decrypt
	 - The sender uses the receiver's *public*-key to *encrypt* their message
	 - The *public*-key can be given to anyone as it cannot decrypt the message
	 - The receiver uses their *private*-key to *decrypt* the message
	 - The *private*-key needs to be kept secret, it doesn't need to be given to anyone


##### RSA - Rivest Shamir Adelson
 - $K^+$ = public key
 - $K^-$ = private key
 - Requirements:
	 - We need a $K^+$ and $K^-$ such that $K^-(K^+(m)) = m$, i.e. we need to be able to apply the public key to the message then the private key and end up with the same message
	 - Given the $K^+$, it should be impossible to compute the $K^-$
 - Calculating the Keys:
	 1. Choose two large prime integers $p,q$, e.g. 1000-2000 bits each
	 2. Compute $n = pq$ and $z = (p-1)(q-1)$
	 3. Choose a number $e$, where $e < n$, that has no common factors with $z$
	 4. Choose a number $d$ such that $ed-1$ is exactly divisible by $z$, i.e. $ed-1 \;\; MOD \;\; z = 1$
	 5. Therefore, the public key is $K^+ = (n,e)$ and the private key is $K^- = (n,d)$
 - Encryption:
	 - Given $K^+ = (n,e)$ as computed above
	 - To encrypt the bit patter $m$, compute
		 - $c = m^e \;\; MOD \;\; n$ -> "the remainder when $m^e$ is divided my $n$"
 - Decryption:
	 - Given $K^- = (n,d)$ as computed above
	 - To decrypt the bit pattern $c$, compute
		 - $m = c^d \;\; MOD \;\; n$, the remainder when $c^d$ is divided by $n$
 - Overall: $m = (m^e \;\; MOD \;\; n)^d \;\; MOD \;\; n$
 - Security - RSA relies on the fact that there is no efficient factorisation algorithm
	 - However, with the rise in quantum computing and the creating of ***Shor's*** algorithm, this encryption technique might be broken in the near future
 - Methods of Attack
	 - Brute force - requires an enormous amount of time to compute


##### The Heartbleed Bug
 - Interesting attack methodology: ![[Pasted image 20251009124703.png]]


##### Shor's Algorithm
 - His algorithm is an integer factorisation algorithm for the quantum computer 
 - It has a polynomial time complexity, much better than current proposals


##### Societal Concerns
 - Should everyone has access to strong encryption?
	 - Yes, this allows regular good people to do what they want without the prying eyes of a governing body.
	 - No, this allows bad people to commit criminal activities while reducing their chance of getting caught


##### Phil Zimmermann
 - In 1991 he created ***PGP*** and published it to the web
 - ***PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)***
	 - It is an encryption program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages, verify the authenticity of senders through digital signatures and encrypt data storage
	 - It uses a combination of public-key and symmetric encryption
 - ***Zimmermann's Law*** states that "the natural flow of technology is in the direction of making surveillance easier and the ability of computers to track us doubles every 18 months"


##### Edward Snowden
 - He leaked information on a variety of surveillance systems
 - Some include; Tempora, Stellar Wind, PRISM, MUSCULAR


##### Aftermath
 - As a result, ***HTTPS*** and ***End-to-end encryption*** was born
 - ***End-to-end Encryption***
	 - Messages are encrypted before they leave the device and only decrypted once they have reached their destination
	 - Some applications that use end-to-end encryption include; iMessage, Signal, WhatsApp, Line and Telegram
