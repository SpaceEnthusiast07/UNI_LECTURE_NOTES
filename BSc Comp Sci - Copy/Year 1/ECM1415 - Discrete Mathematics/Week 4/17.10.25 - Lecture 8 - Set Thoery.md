##### Universal and Empty Set
 - The ***Universal Set*** $U$ is the set containing everything under consideration
	 - Sometimes the set is implicitly or explicitly stated
 - The Empty Set is denoted by $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$ and is the set with no elements


##### Cardinality
 - ***Cardinality*** refers to the *number* $n$ of *distinct* elements in a set
 - If there are exactly $n \in N$ *distinct* elements in $S$, we say $S$ is *finite*
 - A set which is not finite is called *infinite*
 - Examples: ![[Pasted image 20251017094221.png]]


##### Set Equality
 - Two sets $A$ and $B$ are *equal* if and only if they have the *same elements*
$$
A=B \; \leftrightarrow \; \forall x. (x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B)
$$
 - Within the Rooster method, the *order is not important* and *repetitions do not change the set*
 - Examples: ![[Pasted image 20251017095141.png]]


##### Subsets
 - The set $A$ is a *subset* of $B$, denoted by $A \subseteq B$, if and only if *every element* of $A$ is *also an element* of $B$
 - I.e. $A \subseteq B \implies$ $B$ contains $A$ OR $A=B$
 - If $A \subseteq B$, but $A \not= B$, we say $A$ is a *proper subset* of $B$, denoted $A \subset B$
 - Examples: ![[Pasted image 20251017095602.png]]
 - ***Power Set*** - A set containing all the subsets of a set $A$, denoted by $\wp (A)$
 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017100058.png]]


##### Proving a Set is a Subset of another Set
 - Steps:
	 - To show that $A \subseteq B$, *assume* $x$ belongs to $A$ and *show that* $x$ also belongs to $B$
	 - To show that $A$ is not a subset of $B$, find an element $x \in A$ where $x \notin B$
 - Examples: ![[Pasted image 20251017100528.png]]


##### Basic Operations
 - ***Union***
	 - The *union* of the sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, is the set: $\{x \; | \; x \in A \; \lor \; x \in B\}$
	 - I.e. a set *combining* both sets, removing duplicates
	 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017101103.png]]
 - ***Intersection***
	 - The *intersection* of the sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cap B$, is the set: $\{x \; | \; x \in A \; \land \; x \in B\}$
	 - I.e. a set only containing *elements in both* $A$ and $B$
	 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017101328.png]]
 - ***Difference***
	 - The difference of the sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A - B$, is the set: $\{x \; | \; x \in A \; \land \; x \notin B\}$
	 - I.e. a set containing elements *only from* set $A$, *non from* set $B$
	 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017101834.png]]
 - ***Complement***
	 - The *complement* of the set $A$ (with respect to $U$), denoted by $\bar A$, is the set: $\bar A = U - A \text{ (the difference of set U and A) } = \{x \; | \; x \in U \; \land \; x \notin A\}$
	 - I.e. a set containing *elements from* $U$ that are *not in* set $A$
	 - Example: ![[Pasted image 20251017102350.png]]
