##### Equivalences in Predicate Logic
 - Two statements are equivalent if and only if they have the same truth value for every predicate and domain
 - Example: $∀x. ¬¬S(x) ≡ ∀x. S(x)$
 - Question: Which equivalences hold? *Both are true*
	 - $∀x. P(x) ≡ P(1) ∧ P(2) ∧ P(3)$
	 - $∃x. P(x) ≡ P(1) ∨ P(2) ∨ P(3)$


##### De Morgan's Laws for Quantifiers
 - 1st Law: $¬ (∀x. P(x)) ≡ ∃x. ¬P(x)$
	 - E.g.: *Not* “every student in your class has taken a course in Java” becomes “there is a student in your class who has not taken Java”
 - 2nd Law: $¬ (∃x. P(x)) ≡ ∀x. ¬P(x)$


##### Nested Quantifiers
 - We often need to use nested quantifiers in order to express the meaning of sentences in English
	 - E.g.: "Every real number has an inverse" -> $∀x∃y. (x + y = 0)$
 - You can also think about nested quantifiers as nested formulas
	 - E.g. $∀x. Q(x)$ where $Q(x) is ∃y. (x + y = 0)$
 - Question: $∃x. (P(x) ∧ ∀y. (P(y) → y = x)$ = False
 - You can think of nested quantifiers as nested loops


##### Order of Quantifiers
 - Some times the order of the nested quantifiers doesn't matter!
 - Example when it doesn't matter: ![[Pasted image 20251003100829.png]]
 - Example when it does matter: ![[Pasted image 20251003100845.png]]
 - When a quantifier is duplicated, the order doesn't matter: ![[Pasted image 20251003101526.png]]
 - If the statement consists of more than one quantifier, the order isn't always important: ![[Pasted image 20251003101646.png]]


##### Quantification of Two or more Variables

 - Quantifications of more than two variables is also common: ![[Pasted image 20251003102324.png]]


##### Constructing New Logical Equivalences
 - Similar to propositional logic, we can prove that $A ≡ B$ by producing a series of equivalences beginning with A and ending with B: ![[Pasted image 20251003102542.png]]
