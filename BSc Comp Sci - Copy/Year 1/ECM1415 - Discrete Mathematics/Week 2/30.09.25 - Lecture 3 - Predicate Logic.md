##### Properties of Equality
![[Pasted image 20250930134210.png]]
 - ***Transitivity*** -> if $p≡q$ and $q≡r$ then $p≡r$
 - ***Substitution*** -> assume $q$ is a sub-expression of $p$, and $q≡q'$ therefore, $p'$ is the expression where $q$ is replaced with $q'$ in $p$
	 - This law allows us to work on sub-expressions without affecting the whole expression


## *Continuing with current lecture - [Slides](https://ele.exeter.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/5347817/mod_resource/content/0/Handouts_02_1.pdf)*

##### Predicate Logic
 - ***Variables*** -> to denote objects from a certain domain: $x, y, z$
	 - Unlike propositional logic where variables represented propositions
 - ***Predicates*** -> to denote a property of a subject: $P(x), M(x)$
	 - You can think of this as a function, *I think*
 - ***Quantifiers*** -> to quantify over objects
 - ***Domain*** -> The set of inputs, denoted by $U$
 - Example:
	 - If U Consists of
