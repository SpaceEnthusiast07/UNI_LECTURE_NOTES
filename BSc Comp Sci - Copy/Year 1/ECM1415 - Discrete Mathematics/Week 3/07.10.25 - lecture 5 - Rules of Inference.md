##### Arguments
 - An ***argument*** is a sequence of propositions with the last being a *conclusion* and all previous ones being *premises*.
 - The *goal* of an *argument* is to show that the conclusion *follows from* the premises.
 - ***Premises***: propositions presented as *assumed* to be *true* (facts).
	 - *Keywords*: "Assume", "Given that", "Suppose", bullet points before the premise
 - ***Conclusion***: the proposition being proven true.
	 - Keywords: "Therefore", "Hence", "Thus" or $\therefore$
 - Example:
	 - *Premise*: "If it rains, then the ground will be wet." $\implies p \rightarrow q$ is true
	 - *Premise*: "It is raining" $\implies \; p$ is true
	 - *Conclusion*: "The ground is wet" $\implies q$ is true
	 - Notes: Since $p \rightarrow q$ is *true* and $p$ is also *true*, from the *implication truth table*, $q$ must also be *true*
 - A ***valid*** argument is an argument where there are *no possible* assignment of *truth values* that make all *premises true* and the *conclusion false*.
 - An ***argument form*** is a *template* for an argument made of metavariables ($p$, $q$, $r$) and connectives


##### Rules of Inference
 - ***Modus Ponens***: an argument that is always valid 
	![[Pasted image 20251019143620.png]]
	 - Rule: from $p \rightarrow q$ and $p$, infer $q$
	 - Tautology: $(p \land (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow q$
	 - Example: let $p$ = "It is snowing" and $q$ = "I will study discrete maths"
		 - "If it is snowing, then I will study discrete maths"
		 - "It is snowing"
		 - "Therefore, I will study discrete maths"
 - ***Modus Tollens***: an argument that is always valid 
	![[Pasted image 20251019144429.png]]
	 - Rule: $p \rightarrow q$ and $¬q$, infer $¬p$
	 - Tautology: $(¬q \land (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow ¬p$
	 - Example: let $p$ = "the alarm is functioning" and $q$ = "alarm will sound when fire ds detected"
		 - "If the alarm is functioning then it will sound when fire is detected" ($p \rightarrow q$)
		 - "The alarm did not sound" ($¬q$)
		 - "Therefore, the alarm is not functioning" ($¬p$)

 - ***Building Valid Arguments***
	 - A ***valid argument*** is a sequence of statements, such that each statement is either a *premise* or *follows form a previous statement* by rules of inference
	 - Steps:
		 - Number each line in the argument
		 - State the formula and rule used (and reference the line used)
		 - Show that from the original statement, you can infer another statement
	 - Example: Show that from $p \land (p \rightarrow q)$ follows $q$
		 -             *Step*               |                    *Reason*
		 - --------------------------------------------------------------
		 - 1.    $p \land (p \rightarrow q)$         |                   Premise
		 - 2.           $p$                  |           Simplification of (1)
		 - 3.       $p \rightarrow q$               |           Simplification of (1)
		 - 4.           $q$                  |    Modus Ponens using (2) and (3)


##### Quantifiers
 - ***Universal Instantiation*** (UI) - eliminating $\forall$
	 - From $\forall x. P(x)$ infer $P(c)$ for a particular $c$ in the domain
	 - Example: Our domain consists of all dogs and Fido is a dog
		 - "All dogs are cuddly" -> $\forall x. P(x)$
		 - "Therefore, Fido is cuddly" -> $P( \text{ Fido } )$
 - ***Universal Generalisation*** (UG) - introducing the $\forall$
	 - From $P(c)$ (for an arbitrary $c$), infer $\forall x. P(x)$
	 - Example: Our domain consists of all dogs
		 - "We show that an arbitrary dog taken from the domain is cuddly"
		 - "Therefore, all dogs are cuddly"
	 - You *cannot assume anything* about $c$, e.g. if $c=0$ or $c$ is prime is assumed, UG is not allowed
 - ***Existential Instantiation*** (EI) - eliminating $\exists$
	 - From $\exists x. P(x)$, infer $P(c)$ (for an element $c$)
	 - Example:
		 - "There is someone who got an A in the course"
		 - "Therefore we can call this person $a$ and say that $a$ got an A"
 - ***Existential Generalisation*** (EG) - introducing $\exists$
	 - From $P(c)$ infer $\exists x. P(x)$
	 - Example:
		 - "Michelle got an A in the class"
		 - "Therefore, someone got an A in the class"
