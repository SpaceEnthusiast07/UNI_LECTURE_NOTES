 - We use python for machine learning
 - Why?
	 - Numpy -> fast operations for numerical computing, almost every other ML library is built upon numpy
	 - Pandas -> handles tabular data, DataFrames (like excel spreadsheets in python)
	 - SciKit-Learn -> standard library for classical machine learning, has ready-to-use algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and evaluation everything from linear regression to random forests
	 - PyTorch and TensorFlow -> 
 - Python Setup:
	 - Option 1 -> Text editor (for writing code) and terminal (for executing code)
	 - Option 2 -> IDE (Integrated Development Environment), e.g. Visual Studio Code
	 - Option 3 -> Jupyter Notebook. Its name is derived from three languages; 
		 - ***Ju***lia, ***Pyt***hon, ***R***
	 - Option 4 -> Google Colab. Online and free access to GPUs and TPUs
 - Anaconda:
	 - Install -> ![[Pasted image 20250926105307.png]]
	 - What is it?
		 - Comes with *Python* and the *Data Science Toolkit*
		 - Includes Jupyter Notebook and 1500+ scientific packages
		 - Conda package is installed for easier installs
		 - Can create separate environments for different projects


Python Basics:
 - *Variable* -> 
	 - An area in memory used to store a custom value
	 - Has an identifier for accessing this data throughout the program
	 - This value can change during the execution of the program
	 - The data is volatile, meaning it is lost once the execution of the program is finished
 - *Data Types* - >
	 - Each variable can store a different type of data
 - *Primitive Data Types* ->
	 - These are the fundamental data types of any programming language
	 - They include; integer, float, boolean, character
 - *Complex Data Types* ->
	 - Built using primitive data types
	 - Classes and structures are complex data types
 - Python is strongly typed, meaning you do not have to declare the data type of each variable, python determines this at run time

 - *Lists*  ->
	 - An ordered collection of data items under a single identifier
	 - Items can be removed, appended or modified
	 - Lists are dynamic, their size can increase or decrease
	 - Can only contain a single data type, e.g. a list of characters (also known as a string)
 - *Arrays* ->
	 - Arrays are static, their size cannot increase or decrease
	 - Can only contain a single data type, e.g. an array of integers
 - *Strings* ->
	 - A special data type
	 - Under the hood, this data type is a list of characters
 - Python doesn't have arrays, only lists
 - *Dictionaries* ->
	 - List of key, value pairs
	 - Like a real dictionary; word = key, definition = value

 - *Control Flow*
	 - *if-else if-else* statements:
		 - conditional logic
		 - provides alternative paths through a program
		 - ![[Pasted image 20250926112217.png]]
	 - *for* loops:
		 - repeated execution of a block of code or a predetermined number of iterations
	 - *while* loops:
		 - repeated execution of a block of code while the result of a condition is true

 - *Functions*
	 - functions are reusable sections of code
	 - data can be passed in to be used by the function
