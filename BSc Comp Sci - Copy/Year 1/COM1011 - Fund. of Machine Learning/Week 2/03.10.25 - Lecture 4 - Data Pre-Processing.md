##### Pre-Processing
 - We pre-process data because raw data is very messy and un-structured
 - Machine Learning models require clean data to perform well, meaning bad data results in a weak/bias model!
 - Some problems with raw data include; missing values, duplicates and wrong formats


##### Problems with Raw Data
 - *Missing Values* -> Data such as "Null" or "NaN" are classed as missing values. Their impact includes; limiting the amount of information available for analysis, introduce bias and harm accuracy.
 - *Inaccurate Value* -> Data such as "-1" for an attribute that can only be positive, e.g. number of people in a house hold. Inaccurate values are caused by faulty data collection methods and outdated information. This data causes distorted analysis and misguided strategies.
 - *Inconsistent Values* -> This is data that can be inputted in a variety of formats, such as date of birth, currency or region. Some causes include; multiple data sources and different standards.
 - *Redundant Values* -> This is duplicated data. This can cause biased results and inefficiency.


##### Checking Your Dataset
 - Pandas has a built-in function that provides general information about your dataset and if there are any missing values: ![[Pasted image 20251003105836.png]]
 - Pandas includes a function called `dropna()` which cleans the data by removing records that contain missing values. Pros: simple and cleans data. Cons: reduces sample size and introduces bias.
 - *Interpolation*: Instead of removing records that contain missing values, you can estimate their value based on mean or median. Pros: efficient and works well with numerical data. Cons: Inaccuracy. ![[Pasted image 20251003110646.png]]
 - *Forward/Backward Fill*: Fill in a missing value using the nearest non-missing value from the same column, *forward* or *backward*.
 - *ML Interpolation*: Use a machine learning model to predict the missing values based of previous knowledge and trends within the dataset itself.
 - Pandas includes a function called `drop_duplicates()` that cleans data by removing records that are duplicates.


##### Data Pre-Processing
***Normalisation***:
 - Scales all data points to lie within a given range
 - First identify original min and max, then divide all data points by max to scale everything within the range 0-1.

***Standardisation***:
 - Scales all values so that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1
 - This is the process of converting a normal distribution to the standard normal in A-Level Statistics!!! ðŸ˜‚
