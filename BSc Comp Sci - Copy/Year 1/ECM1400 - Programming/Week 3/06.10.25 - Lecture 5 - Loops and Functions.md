##### Loops
 - While:
	 - Executes the body of code while a boolean condition is true
	 - Used if the number of iterations is unknown
	 - While loop structure
```python
while <boolean condition>:
	#body
```
 - For:
	 - Executes the body of code a set number of times
	 - Used when the number of iterations is known
	 - `i` = iteration counter
	 - `a` = initial value for `i`, default 0
	 - `b` = end value for `i`, non-inclusive
	 - `c` = iteration step, e.g. 1 or 4, default 1
	 - For loop structure
```python
for i in range(a, b, c):
	#body
```


##### Break and Continue
 - ***Break*** when encountered, exits a loop prematurely, no further execution
 - ***Continue*** when encountered, the loop stops any further execution and continues with the next iteration


##### Functions
 - They are self contained blocks of code that can be called from anywhere within the program and can optionally `return` a value
 - The code within usually performs one specific job, e.g. calculate the area of a rectangle
 - Functions can only be called if the call point is within the correct scope, i.e. can "see" the function
 - ***Method*** = a function associated with a class/object, e.g. `object.doSomething()` - `doSomething()` is a method
 - ***Procedure*** = a function that does something but doesn't return a useful value, e.g. `object.turnOnLights()` - `turnOnLights()` is a procedure
 - They have identifiers (e.g.`calcRecArea`) used to call them
 - ***Parameters*** these are the listed variables in the function declaration (placeholders), e.g. `def add(a, b):` - `a` and `b` are parameters
 - ***Arguments*** these are the actual data objects you pass into a function when called, e.g. `add(2, 3)` - `2` and `3` are arguments
 - `return` allows the function to pass data back to the call point
 - Example function structure for `Python` and `Java`
```python
# Defining the function calcRecArea
def calcRecArea(width, height):
	return width * height

# Calling the function and passing in some values
rectangleArea = calcRecArea(12.5, 16.3)
```

```java
// Defining the function calcRecArea
public float calcRecArea(float width, float height) {
	return width * height;
}

// Calling the function and passing in some values
float rectangleArea = calcRecArea(12.5, 16.3);
```


##### Namespaces
 - Namespaces are containers for holding ***names***
 - The term ***names*** encapsulates variables, functions and classes
 - They allow you to organise code (group related things together) and avoid naming collisions
 - You can nest namespaces within each other
