##### Mathematical (Arithmetic) Operators:
 - Addition (`+`)
 - Subtraction (`-`)
 - Multiplication (`*`)
 - Division (`/`) -> returns float
 - Integer Division (`//`) -> rounds down to nearest integer
 - Exponentiation (`**`)


##### Program Representation:
 - Flowchart
	 - Visual graphical way to create algorithms
	 - Easier as removes the need to worry about syntax
	 - Symbols:
		 - Oval = start/end
		 - Rectangle = action/command/process
		 - Diamond = decision
		 - Parallelogram = input/output
		 - Arrow = flow direction


##### Control Flow:
 - ***Sequence***
	 - Statements are executed in the order they are provided
	 - E.g.
```python
	x = "Hello World"
	print(x)
```
 - ***Selection***
	 - Provides difference paths/branches for a program to follow based on the result of a condition
	 - This logic is provided by if statements
	 - E.g.
```python
	x = 5
	if (x == 3):
		print("Hello Mike")
	elif (x = 10):
		print("Hello Alice")
	else:
		print("Hello Bob")
```
 - ***Iteration***
	 - Allows you to repeat the execution of a code block multiple times
	 - `for` loops allow repeated execution for a predetermined number of times
	 - `while` loops allow repeated execution while a condition is true (un-known number of time)
	 - E.g.
```python
	# for loop example
	for i in range(10):    # non-inclusive range
		print(i)           # outputs: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
	
	# while loop example
	x = 0
	while x < 10:
		x++        # increments x by 1
		print(x)   # outputs: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
```
 - ***Recursion***


##### Comparison Operators
 - The result of these comparisons is a boolean value
 - Less than (`<`)
 - Greater than (`>`)
 - Equal to (`==`)
 - Not equal to (`!=`)
 - Less than or equal to (`<=`)
 - Greater than or qual to (`>=`)
 - Contains (`in`)


##### Boolean Operators:
 - Negation (logical `not`)
 - Conjunction (logical `and`)
 - Disjunction (logical `or`)


##### Precedence:
 - Arithmetic operators have a higher precedence than boolean operators
 - Arithmetic operators abide by BIDMAS
