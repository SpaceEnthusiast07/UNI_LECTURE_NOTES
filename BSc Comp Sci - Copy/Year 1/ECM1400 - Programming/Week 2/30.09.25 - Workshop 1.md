##### Notes:
 - Program = Countdown (the TV game show)
 - Console based, no GUI

##### Decomposition stage:
 - File reader
 - Random character selector
	 - Ask the user to input a sequence of c's and v's for a total of 9
		 - c = consonant
		 - v = vowel
	 - Define two arrays
 - Dictionary reader
 - Word lookup

##### File reader
 - Read the contents of the file `words.txt` into a list

##### Random character selector
- Ask the user to input a sequence of c's and v's for a total of 9
	- c = consonant
	- v = vowel
- Define two arrays that hold consonants and vowels respectively
- For each character in the user input, identify if it is a c or v
- Use the random library to access the random choices function
- If a c, then randomly choose a consonant from the list of consonants
- If a v, then randomly choose a vowel from the list of vowels
- Add each randomly chosen character to a string
- Provide this string to the user

##### Dictionary Reader
